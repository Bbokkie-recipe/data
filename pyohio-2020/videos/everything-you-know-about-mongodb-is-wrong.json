    "description": "MongoDB is webscale, right? It's a JSON database, it uses map-reduce,\nit's eventually consistent. Oh, and it's insecure.\n\nLet me take 10 minutes to clear up some things: MongoDB is an\nACID-compliant database with transactions, schemas & relationships. It\nincludes a powerful aggregation query language. MongoDB doesn't speak or\nstore JSON, and nowadays it comes with pretty good security defaults (we\nthink).\n\nI'll cover all of this and more, so you know what you need to if you're\nconsidering MongoDB for your next (or current) project.\n",
