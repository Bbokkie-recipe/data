    "description": "Working with dates and times in Python can lead to frustration,\nheartache, and, ironically, lost time \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have to! This\nbrief demo introduces Delorean, a library constructed to make datetime\nmanipulation in Python easier. Participants will discover how they can\nuse Delorean\n\n-  to do datetime arithmetic,\n-  to handle time zone shifts,\n-  to convert datetimes into human language like \u201c3 days from now,\u201d and\n-  to generate equally spaced datetime intervals.\n",
