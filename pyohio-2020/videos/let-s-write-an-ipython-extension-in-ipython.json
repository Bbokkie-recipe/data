    "description": "IPython is a Python REPL on steroids. It has many features, but if they\nare not enough, you can easily add new ones by writing an extension. In\nthis talk, I will show you how to write one. We will build a simple code\nprofiler that will measure the execution time of each command. And, for\nan additional challenge, I will do everything without closing IPython.\n",
