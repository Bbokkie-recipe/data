    "description": "When I tell people about grants they could get to help fund work on open\nsource software projects, sometimes they are surprised because they\ndidn't know such grants existed. I share:\n\n-  sample foundations and funders (such as\n   `Mozilla <https://www.mozilla.org/moss>`__, the `Chan Zuckerberg\n   Initiative <https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/>`__,\n   `NLNet <https://nlnet.nl/>`__, and\n   `Comcast <https://innovationfund.comcast.com/>`__) who want to fund\n   open source software projects, and how much they're paying out\n-  a quick case study on how the Python Software Foundation got funding\n   from Open Tech Fund to `improve security, accessibility, and\n   localization for\n   PyPI <https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG#Warehouse:_OTF_grant>`__\n-  key steps in figuring out a good project idea, budgeting, hiring, and\n   submitting\n-  how the new `Project Funding Working\n   Group <https://wiki.python.org/psf/ProjectFundingWG>`__ at the PSF\n   can help you along the way\n",
