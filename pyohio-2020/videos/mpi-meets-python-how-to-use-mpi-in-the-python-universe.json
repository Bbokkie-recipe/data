    "description": "The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a programming paradigm used in\nParallel applications to allow for communication amongst processes. In\norder to process large amounts of data and efficiently deal with complex\noperations, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) provides primitives\noptimized specifically to handle such cases. The increasing need for\napplying parallelism to applications with growing complexity, is handled\nthrough the use of MPI to scale across machines and to efficiently\nutilize all available resources.\n\nIn this talk, we will detail various MPI primitives and delve into their\nuse cases that are applicable for modern-day high performance computing\nneeds. We will explore the MPI layer in the realm of Python and define\navailable means to utilize MPI with python.\n",
