    "description": "Time series data provides helpful insights about trends, seasonality and\nvariance in applications varying from finance to the environment to\npersonal sensors. But what do you do when you have hundreds or thousands\nof time series?\n\nEnter time series clustering. In this talk, Susan Devitt, Senior Data\nScientist, will introduce two algorithms for time series clustering -\nShape Based Distance and Dynamical Time Warp - implemented in the python\npackage dtwclust. Taking a real world example using daily financial\ntransaction data, she will show you when to consider clustering and how\nit can be used for anomaly detection.\n",
