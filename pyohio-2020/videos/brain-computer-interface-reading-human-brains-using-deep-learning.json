    "description": "Idea : Using deep learning to train and build a model that could read\nthe human brain\n\n1 in 8 people in the US alone suffers from muteness today. Statistics\nrelated to the number of cases of Autism and other speaking disorder is\nquite disappointing too. In recent years, researchers and scientists\nhave successfully used deep learning to read brain signals and translate\nthem into human-readable language like English. Hence, Deep learning has\ngiven us all the hope to provide voiceless the voice.\n",
