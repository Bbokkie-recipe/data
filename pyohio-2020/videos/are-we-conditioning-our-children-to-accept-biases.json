    "description": "Language being the center of human interactions can be used\naffirmatively or destructively. It\u2019s usage forms the basis of our\nsocieties, our stories and our narratives. When children grow up in a\nworld where the stories consistently entitle them or belittle them, they\nwill internalize these beliefs without question. NLP considerably\nautomates the analysis that is paramount to setting the world right when\nit comes to these societal beliefs. NLP has the potential to be an\nexcellent equalizer. Most children pick up notions from their\neducational texts and the rules at their educational institute. Thus,\nanalyzing, identifying and eliminating cultural biases in the literature\nused to educate would be among the first steps to fostering an equal\nworld. This presentation has an interdisciplinary basis, borrowing\nconcepts from psychology, linguistics, literature, statistics and\ncomputer science.\n",
