    "description": "On the first Sunday of November you may get \u201cone more hour of sleep\u201d but\nas well may spend much more time debugging code dealing with the time\nzones, daylight saving time shifts and datetime stuff in general. We'll\nlook at a few pitfalls you may encounter when working with datetimes in\nPython. We'll dissect the pytz library, explain why it contains over 400\nindividual time zones while focusing on the 29 entries in the USA. We'll\nalso find the reason why pytz is not part of the standard Python, why it\ngets updated so often and why even that won't solve all your problems.\nAnd no, PEP 615 will not save you either. Two centuries of short-sighted\npropaganda and long-term chaos in ten minutes. Maybe that will make you\nwant to avoid time zones in your code altogether!\n",
