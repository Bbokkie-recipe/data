    "description": "The year was 2018. I was studying computer science at the University of Indonesia. I learned Django as part of a web programming course. At the time, Django felt just like any other framework out there \u2013 it's part of the tech stack that you use.\n\nA year later, I tried my luck with Django in [Google Summer of Code](https://g.co/gsoc). I took a deep dive into Django's codebase to implement the cross-database `JSONField`. The feature managed to make it in Django 3.1.\n\nFast forward to now, I've got a job in the UK to work on the Django-powered Wagtail CMS.  Since then, I've had the opportunity to give talks at conferences in Europe and the US, including this one.\n\nThis is a story of how Django changed ~~my life~~ people's lives \u2013 and how you played a part in it.\n\nIn this talk, we'll go through:\n- How Django can be used to teach web programming\n- Django's participation in Google Summer of Code\n- The awesome Django community and what it means for us\n- What we can do to make Django change the lives of even more people",
