    "description": "We pay great attention to how to write composable python code (with inheritance, decorators, modules, namespaces, etc). But when it comes to architecting the templates of your website, this is often overlooked, which rapidly degenerates in tons of copy&paste of html, css and javascript.\nSome might say that this is what React or Vue (et al) are all about and already solve, but having to render HTML on the client can increase the complexity of the application (introducing build steps, another language, more dependencies, etc).\n  \nWriting reusable and composable UI components can be achieved using the good 'ol django templates, with the help of some libraries to fill in the gaps (like django-components, django-cotton and TailwindCSS) that we will explore and suggest as a possible solution.",
