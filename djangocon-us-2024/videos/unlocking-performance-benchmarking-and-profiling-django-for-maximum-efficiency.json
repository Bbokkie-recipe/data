    "description": "In most cases performance issues are caused by a very small fraction of the application.  Identifying these bottlenecks can be a daunting task. Well, not anymore, we now have tools to easily identify these bottlenecks. In this talk we will talk about it all: the why, what and how to do profiling and benchmarking.\n\nWe will look at `django-silk` for profiling while for benchmarking we will be using the ever reliable `pytest-benchmark`. We will cover the basics and slowly move into seeing things like the actual raw query buried which is buried in Django. Lastly l will share tips on how to avoid over running your services while try to optimise. This talk is suitable for intermediate to senior developers, however junior developers can also benefit.",
