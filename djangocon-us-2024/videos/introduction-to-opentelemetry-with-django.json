    "description": "OpenTelemetry (OTel) is an observability framework for cloud-native software. It provides standardized APIs, libraries, and tools to collect telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. OTel is open source and vendor neutral, designed to work with any backend system.\n\nThis talk will present several examples demonstrating why logs alone may be insufficient, along with the benefits of incorporating extra signals. These benefits include enhanced visibility into the execution flow and call timing, metrics on how users utilize services to pinpoint unnecessary ones, and the ability to detect patterns, such as peak usage times, which aids in production planning and scaling.",
