    "description": "Positive asynchronous working relationships have always been a core feature of what makes Django successful. Many of us have spent our careers working asynchronously across International borders and timezones, but it's new to many of our clients, employers, and project stakeholders. \n\nIn this talk, I'd like to discuss an important ingredient of successful asynchronous work: clear, concise communication. We'll discuss the importance of establishing clear boundaries and expectations early and often. We'll learn how to write excellent issues and pull requests, and how to tailor your writing to various audiences and purposes that arise in every project. We'll talk about when scheduling a meeting is actually a good idea, and how to communicate your successes, status reports, and blockers to those who need to know.\n\nClear communication is the key to good working relationships. Good working relationships make for happier, more productive teams, healthier work/life balance, and ultimately optimized profits and delivery. Let's work better together!",
