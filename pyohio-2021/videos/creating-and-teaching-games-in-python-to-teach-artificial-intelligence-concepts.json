    "description": "I am a High School Freshman who enjoys coding and robotics. For the past\n3 years, I have taken Artificial Intelligence classes as a student. AI\nis a buzz word - It is an exciting yet daunting subject. My instructor\nmade these classes fun and less daunting by using real world examples\nand games. I got so inspired, I started understanding and writing neural\nnetworks in Python in no time. Now, I am trying to create the same\nexperience for my students.\n\nI am a volunteer teacher at https://www.corp.aiclub.world/ where I teach\nAI concepts to students in 6th - 12th grade. When I create a course, I\nthink of how to include AI concepts in games. I write games utilizing\nlibraries like turtle and pygame. I consult with my instructor and they\nhelp review my courses.\n\nI would like to share my approach, give the audiences a sneak peak at my\ncurriculum, and share some resources that I have created.\n\nHere are some examples of my curriculum:\n\n-  `A Cheat Sheet I made for students`_\n-  `TicTacToe using AI`_\n-  `Stock Predictor using AI`_\n\n.. _A Cheat Sheet I made for students: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTM4zhnyI6ZvvGffhJ6tJTJnfBGc_Hwn5Rc_3oTwOSM/edit?usp=sharing\n.. _TicTacToe using AI: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aUIV6jAahnLCWUlGNwtWbg4ew6Q0afl3aSMgEVAaIkE/edit?usp=sharing\n.. _Stock Predictor using AI: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HbtudvKDDbJNVzORYFK-6QyyY7YT7-r1OoEZtTZoVg0/edit?usp=sharing\n",
