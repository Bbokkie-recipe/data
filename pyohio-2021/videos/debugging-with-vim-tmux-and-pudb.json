Or are you just someone\nwho prefers using vim and tmux like myself? What if there was a way to\ndebug your code in an interface that doesn't require a huge IDE in order\nto run? This talk will guide you through using vim, tmux, and pudb to\neffectively debug code in various situations. We'll show how to insert\nbreakpoints into the code and do remote debugging, all from the comfort\nof a tmux shell.\n",
