    "description": "Every year thousands of developers try to solve the programming puzzles\nof the Advent of Code\\ `1`_ challenge. For many Pythonistas, their\nfavorite tool to do that is the Jupyter notebook. As the problems get\nprogressively more challenging, solving them step-by-step is an\nexcellent approach. You read some data, play with it, solve the\nsmall-scale problem and then try to solve the whole challenge.\n\nApart from showing the output of each intermediate step, Jupyter\nnotebooks offer plenty of useful features. Including:\n\n-  Easy access to the documentation\n-  Different debugging mechanisms\n-  Lightweight storage\n-  Shell commands\n-  Pastebin support\n\nIn this lightning talk, I will show you how to use them when solving\nproblems in Jupyter Notebooks.\n\n----\n\n   #. \n\n      .. container::\n         :name: fn:1\n\n         If you never heard about the Advent of Code - it's a series of\n         25 code challenges. Each of them is released daily between the\n         1st and 25th of December. It's like the advent calendar\n         (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar), but instead of\n         chocolate or a small gift, you get frustration if you can't\n         solve a given problem.
