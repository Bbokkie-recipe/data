    "description": "Software architecture has a bad rep. It's supposed to be tricky,\ndifficult, erudite. That's crazy.\n\nArchitecture is about writing code that is effective: it's about finding\nyour target audience, identifying what they need, and thinking about how\nto make it easy to do THAT. That's it.\n\nThis talk is about 5 basic principles for software architecture that can\nbe applied to projects big and small: correctness, clarity, simplicity,\nmodularity and empathy. It's about boiling architecture down to it's\nbare essence - ergonomics. We'll look at these 5 principles and end up\nwith 4 super-distilled lessons that we can apply TODAY to our code to\nmake it better.\n",
