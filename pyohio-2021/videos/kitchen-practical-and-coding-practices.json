    "description": "A whirlwind tour of the evolution of kitchens from Victorian caverns to\ndomestic economy, and what that transition can teach us about the very\nreal value of code ergonomics. This talk is based on Lillian Gilbreth's\ndomestic research and revolutions, and applies to the very screen you\nare looking at right now. Come for the iceboxes, apply science to your\nIDEs.\n",
