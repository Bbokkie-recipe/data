    "description": "Datasette is described by its creator, Simon Willison, as \"a tool for\nexploring and publishing data\", and it provides an amazing data\npresentation, exploration, and retrieval platform that can rapidly be\ndeployed to local, cloud or traditional web servers. In this Thunder\nTalk, I'll demonstrate a project where I deployed an instance of\nDatasette at the Cincinnati & Hamilton County Public Library to rapidly\nprovide reports to domain experts who are focusing on item and\nbibliographic record data.\n\nDatasette Project\n-----------------\n\nhttps://datasette.io/\n\nCincinnati & Hamilton County Public Library Collection-Analysis\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nhttps://ilsweb.cincinnatilibrary.org/collection-analysis/\n",
