    "description": "I maintain Hypothesis, a library to automatically generate inputs to\nyour tests (like \"a list of integers\" or \"an object matching this\ndatabase schema\") -- so you don't have to think of all the edge-cases\nyourself. But we can go further! Hypothesis now ships with a\n\"Ghostwriter\" which can write tests for you, based on the function and\nargument names you choose (and docstrings and type annotations, if you\nuse those).\n\nIf you're tired of testing but still don't want bugs, come see how we\ncan take automation to a whole new level :-)\n",
