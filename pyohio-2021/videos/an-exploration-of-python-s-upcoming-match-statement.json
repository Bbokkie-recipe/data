    "description": "The match statement is a new feature of the Python language, defined in\nPEP-634 and will be standard in the upcoming Python 3.10 (due out in\nOctober 2021).\n\nAdding syntax for new language features introduces both new\npossibilities and sources for confusion. Let's stay ahead of the game by\nlearning what to expect from the match statement by playing with the\nalpha version of Python (available now).\n\nThis talk will compare the match statement to similar constructs in\nother languages, demonstrate some typical use cases, briefly discuss\nPython's implementation, and propose some best practices when solving\nproblems with the match statement.\n",
