    "description": "| In the past several months, we have seen that effectively distributing\n  COVID-19 vaccinations is an incredibly important and daunting task.\n  Due to a wide and asymmetric imbalance between supply and demand,\n  finding the right balance, timing, and utilization of vaccinations has\n  proven difficult for everyone involved. Organizations need to\n  correctly predict demand at different times at specific locations to\n  minimize spoilage and optimize utilization rate while accounting for\n  limited supply.\n| In this talk, Samira Soleimani, Data Scientist at CGI, will\n  demonstrate how machine learning algorithm and multi-objective\n  optimization can be used to help tackle this challenge. First, Samira\n  will explain the difference between single-objective and\n  multi-objective optimizations. Second, she will introduce and compare\n  line and curve-fitting approaches to define objective functions for\n  distribution optimization. Then, she will explain and implement\n  multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the python\n  package \u201cPyGMO\u201d to find the optimal point for vaccine distribution in\n  a neighborhood.\n",
