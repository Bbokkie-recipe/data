    "description": "Every software project should have some degree of testing. Why? No code\nis perfect, and bugs happen! Unfortunately, many people don't write\ntests because they feel like it's too much work, or they don't know how\nto start.\n\nIn this lightning talk, I'll show you how to start testing your code\nusing ``pytest``. We will cover how to configure ``pytest``, where to\nput tests, and how to write concise yet meaningful tests. Slides will\ninclude example code with full test cases. I'll also share resources for\nlearning more advanced techniques. In 5 minutes flat, you'll see just\nhow easy it is to add valuable tests to your Python projects!\n",
