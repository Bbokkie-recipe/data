    "description": "The United States is facing an urgent crisis in the treatment of its\nmilitary veterans. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious\nhealth issue assailing our veteran population. There are currently\n300,000+ disability claims and appeals pending in the Board of Veteran\nAffairs\u2019 (BVA) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. PTSD claims\nmakeup at least 22% of that total. Presently, the timeline from claim to\nappeal exceeds 4 years. This logjam in the VA claims and appeals can be\nmitigated by automating this process using machine learning techniques.\n\nAll PTSD claims are legal arguments. As such, all legal arguments must\nhave structured reasoning. Using this legal structure, documents can be\nprocessed by Python NLP machine learning models. These models can be\nused to streamline the process of adjudicating the claims and appeals.\n\n| Slides: https://bit.ly/DeepLearningPTSD\n| Paper: https://github.com/deborahanneharris/legal-documents/\n",
