    "description": "I am enamored with dataclasses. I love them in Python, I love them in\nKotlin. A while back I was looking for a Kotlin dataclass feature in\nPython, and was disappointed to find it wasn't there. I went digging\ninto the CPython source code to see if it could be added and found the\ncraziest function I'd ever seen, \\_create_fn, and it's used everywhere\nin the dataclass implementation!\n\nJoin me as I shared what I found out about my dear dataclasses, and get\na better understand of decorators and metaprogramming in Python!\n",
