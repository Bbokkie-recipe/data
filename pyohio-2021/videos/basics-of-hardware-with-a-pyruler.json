    "description": "Learn how hardware works without having to learn C. Explore basic\nembedded hardware concepts with me as we use CircuitPython and a\nPyRuler. CircuitPython is a programming language that simplifies writing\ncode for microcontrollers. The PyRuler is an engineering reference for\nsizes of various electronic components, but it's also a microcontroller\nboard complete with LEDs, capactive touch buttons, and various inputs\nand outputs that let you get started designing your embedded system with\nlittle to no hardware experience.\n\nResources: `Python Hardware w/ PyRuler`_\n\n.. _Python Hardware w/ PyRuler: https://github.com/kirakirakira/python-hardware-pyruler\n",
