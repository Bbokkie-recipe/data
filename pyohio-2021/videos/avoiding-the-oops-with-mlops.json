    "description": "Machine Learning (ML) projects are gaining ground in industry, yet 87%\nnever pass the experiment phase. So often we pour endless time and money\nbuilding models to help us make predictions about the world, but even\ntop performing models cannot deliver on their intended purpose if they\nare not able to efficiently run in their intended environment. Machine\nLearning Operations (MLOps) strives for automation and monitoring at all\nsteps of ML system development and construction so projects have a\ngreater chance of becoming operationalized. With MLOps we have the\nopportunity to apply traditional DevOps principles that have transformed\nthe world of software delivery, like unification of system development\nand operations, to machine learning. This talk will cover the principles\nof MLOps and outline the path to making ML in production a reality.\n",
