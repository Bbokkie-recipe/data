    "description": "Time zones are complicated, but they are a fact of engineering life.\nTime zones have `skipped entire\ndays <http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-16351377>`__ and repeated\nothers. There are time zones that switch to `DST twice per\nyear <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/morocco/casablanca>`__. But\nnot necessarily every year. In Python it's even possible to create\ndatetimes with non-transitive equality (``a == b``, ``b == c``,\n``a != c``).\n\nIn this talk you'll learn about Python's time zone model and other\nconcepts critical to avoiding datetime troubles. Using the ``zoneinfo``\nmodule introduced in Python 3.9 (`PEP\n615 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0615/>`__), this talk covers\nhow to deal with ambiguous and imaginary times, datetime arithmetic\naround a Daylight Savings Time transition, and datetime's new ``fold``\nattribute, introduced in Python 3.6 (`PEP\n495 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0495/>`__).\n",
