    "description": "In this talk the audience will be briefly introduced to the field of\nmolecular dynamics simulations and its challenges. Special attention\nwill be given to how the features found in Python and its scientific\necosystem are boosting the research in the area, especially in times\nwhere Machine Learning and AI methods are revolutionizing the field.\nExamples using the `OpenMM <https://openmm.org/>`__ and its ecosystem\n(`openmmtools <https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools/>`__,\n`perses <https://github.com/choderalab/perses>`__, among others) will be\nfeatured.\n",
