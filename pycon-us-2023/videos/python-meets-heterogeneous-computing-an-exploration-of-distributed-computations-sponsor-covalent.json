    "description": "In this talk, we will delve into the exciting world of advanced hardware\nand its use for distributed computations. As the heterogeneous computing\nlandscape evolves with the introduction of quantum computers, GPUs, and\nspecialized hardware, we will explore the interesting patterns in Python\nthat allow us to interact with this heterogeneity and maximize\nperformance effectively. The talk will address the challenges of\ndistributed computations in the heterogeneous computing era, including\nmonitoring real-time calculations, rapid iteration, prototyping in\ncomplex experiments, and ensuring smooth production runs with long\naccess queues in specialized hardware. However, we will not only\nhighlight the difficulties but also share valuable strategies for\novercoming these obstacles and achieving optimal performance in these\nenvironments using open-source tools.\n",
