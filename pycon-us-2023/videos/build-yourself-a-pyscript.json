    "description": "PyScript and Pyodide have gained a lot of attention, as Python in the\nbrowser presents interesting opportunities. And architectural questions\nas well. What does it mean to write an extensible, friendly web platform\ntargeting Python?\n\nIn this talk, learn how PyScript works and watch a treatment of key\ntechnical issues for writing web apps with the WebAssembly version of\nPython. What does \u201cfile\u201d mean? How do you install something? What are\nweb workers and how do they impact your architecture?\n\nPyScript itself is constantly evolving on these topics. Come for a\nspirited discussion with a fast-paced format.\n",
