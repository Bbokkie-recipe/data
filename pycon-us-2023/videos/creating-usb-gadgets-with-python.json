    "description": "USB is with us for 26 years. Connecting USB devices to our computers,\nTVs, phones and many other devices became as natural as breathing.\nThroughout these years several mechanism have been developed in Linux to\nfacilitate the process of creating USB devices.\n\nIn this talk I'd like to take you to the other end of the USB plug and\nshow you how to **create your own USB device with Python**. I'll take\nyou through the process of turning RaspberryPi Zero into a USB keyboard.\nI'll show you how to use Python to interact with Linux system internals.\nWe'll find out how to use Python to facilitate and automate the process\nof device creation and configuration. Finally, I'll present the\nimplementation of the logic of a Linux based USB keyboard-like device in\nPython.\n",
