    "description": "What does healthy disagreement look like? Many of us have never\nexperienced healthy conflict at work, and so assume our only options are\nto either avoid conflict or have a nasty fight. But it doesn't have to\nbe that way: professional disagreement can be direct without being\nnasty. We want to show what that looks like.\n\nIn this model argument, presented as a play, watch two engineering\nmanagers disagree about something. How do they work through their\ndisagreement -- politely and effectively? Watch our the characters\nfigure out what they're really clashing about, learn about each other's\nperspectives, and come to a better decision than either could alone.\n",
