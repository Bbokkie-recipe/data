    "description": "MQTT is to connected devices what HTTP is to web applications. It is a\npublish-subscribe protocol specifically designed for devices with\nlimited bandwidth and CPU. MQTT is widely used in home automation,\nindustrial automation, remote monitoring, and everywhere else where\nmachines talk to each other or to a server.\n\nThis talk is an introduction to MQTT for Pythonistas. I\u2019ll start with a\nbrief overview of basic concepts of the protocol. The rest of the\npresentation will be a sequence of code examples in CPython and\nMicropython/CircuitPython, building up to a demo with several devices\npublishing data to each other. Along the way, you will see a few of the\nmost common tools for debugging MQTT communications.\n\nAfter attending this talk you will have a high level idea of Python use\ncases in automation, seen some examples of coding Python for\nmicrocontrollers, and know a whole lot more about four letters that look\nlike an acronym but aren\u2019t actually one. No prior experience with\nautomation or microcontrollers is assumed.\n",
