    "description": "Much of the industry discussion around software testing over the last\ncouple of decades has been focused on web services, but there are lots\nof different types of software systems that have different testing\nneeds. This talk will first explore the differences and similarities\nbetween testing web services and testing safety- and mission-critical\nsoftware systems, such as those used on spacecraft. We will then\nconsider a rubric for thinking about the verification needs of different\ntypes of software based on attributes of the software and the\nenvironments in which it runs. Finally, we will examine a real-world\nexample of using pytest to test Varda Space Industries' spacecraft\nsoftware, showcasing many of pytest's power features, such as its\nfixtures and extensive hook system, as well as Python language features\nsuch as generators, context managers, and threading, that enable\neasy-to-use tools for testing against real-time telemetry streams and\ngenerating rich test report output.\n",
