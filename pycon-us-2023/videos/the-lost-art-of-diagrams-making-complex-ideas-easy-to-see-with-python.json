Over the years I have produced diagrams, charts,\nillustrations and other graphics to help people understand sophisticated\nproject concepts. This includes project architecture, standard operating\nprocedures, coding concepts, sprints and roadmaps.\n\nYou will be guided through ways of how to make stylized examples of your\nproject code and workflows in easy to follow examples. By using common\nsoftware for illustrations along with some simple guidelines you too can\nmake easy to follow visual content for your next project.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nLearn methods to visually communicate with your team including with\ncolor, shapes, images, gifs and even memes to help get a point across\nUnderstand how to make your technical documentation into visual graphics\nwith diagram design style guides See examples of how to take technical\ndocumentation and create an intuitive diagram of it to share Come away\nwith an ability to execute a simple (or sophisticated) graphic with\nessential steps and key requirements\n",
