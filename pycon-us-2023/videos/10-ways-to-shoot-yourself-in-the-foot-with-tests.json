    "description": "Tests are great.\n\nExcept when they\u2019re not.\n\nAlmost every developer who\u2019s worked with tests has encountered a test\nsuite that caused a lot of pain.\n\nSome of them just don\u2019t protect us when we need them, some are flaky,\nsome keep breaking because of unrelated changes, some take hours to\ndebug whenever they fail.\n\nAnd while every company is different, there are definitely patterns. A\nlot of these problems are the result of some common pitfalls that trap\nmany teams. These pitfalls might be common, but they're not easy to spot\n- I\u2019ve seen all of them happen in strong, capable, experienced teams.\nMost of these I fell into myself at least once.\n\nIn this session, we'll take a look at a selection of problematic testing\nchoices, with examples that show these in the context of common Python\nframeworks and libraries. We'll discuss how to identify them, what\nproblems they might cause and what alternatives we have so we can save\nourselves the pain.\n",
