    "description": "In the world of AI and natural language processing, privacy and utility\noften find themselves engaged in a delicate dance. As users attempt to\nleverage the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for\nsensitive or confidential data, they face the challenge of maintaining\nprivacy without compromising the value these models bring. Enter the\n\"ChatGPT Privacy Tango\" \u2013 a metaphor for the intricate steps needed to\nbalance these competing interests.\n\nDuring this talk, we'll delve into a system we've designed to help users\nnavigate the Privacy Tango, striking a balance between preserving\nprivacy and maximizing utility with ChatGPT and LLMs. We'll discuss the\nsignificance of protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and\nmaintaining data security while still enjoying the advantages of\nAI-powered language models. Additionally, we'll cover the pros and cons\nof this approach and touch on alternative systems that we've considered.\n\nWe invite you to join us as we explore the fascinating interplay of data\nprivacy, secure enclaves, and PII removal, shedding light on the path\ntowards more privacy-aware applications with Large Language Models. By\nthe end of our session, you'll be better prepared to dance the ChatGPT\nPrivacy Tango, armed with the knowledge and tools needed to safeguard\nsensitive information while harnessing the power of ChatGPT and LLMs.\n",
