    "description": "While working from home has its perks, you've found one thing missing in\nyour remote work life: speed of network data transfer. It doesn't matter\nif you can write the most efficient Python data transformation code when\nyour jobs are bottlenecked by slow data movement happening between your\nlocal laptop and remote servers.\n\nIn this talk we will address techniques for querying and joining data\nacross distant machines efficiently with Python. We will also discuss\nhow to handle scenarios where you need to join datasets that won't fit\nin your laptop's memory, including several techniques and packages for\nmaking cross server joins.\n\nThis session won't stop you from getting angry when your ISP throttles\nyour home internet connection, but it will teach you ways to work with\nlocal and remote datasets as efficiently as possible.\n",
