    "description": "Over the past several years, large-scale hacks triggered by compromised\nsoftware supply chains have dominated the news. The aftermath has\ninspired the creation of new organizations, tools, and systems to help\nprevent and respond to similar lines of attack in the future.\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about the insidious nature of supply chain\nattacks, common points of intrusion, and why the open source ecosystem\nis especially vulnerable. Next, you\u2019ll learn about the basic concepts\nand terms involved in supply chain security and learn about open source\nprojects and frameworks you can apply to protect the integrity of your\nown software. Lastly, you\u2019ll learn about ways that you can evaluate the\nsupply chain security practices of the dependencies you rely on. You\u2019ll\nleave the talk understanding how supply chain attacks happen, why\nthey\u2019re so difficult to detect, and take away actionable solutions\nallowing you to be better prepared for the next wave of supply chain\nattacks.\n",
