    "description": "How good is your test suite? Would it all still pass if the tested code\nwas changed? If so, there may be problems with your code, your tests, or\nboth!\n\nMutation Testing reveals these cases. It makes lots of slightly altered\nversions of your code, called \"mutants\". If any mutants let all of the\ncode's tests pass, you probably have gaps in your test suite,\nineffective code, or both.\n\nThis talk will tell you what mutation testing is, how it works, how to\nuse it, and its benefits, drawbacks, inner workings, and history. There\nwill be several examples, and a list of tools for many popular\nlanguages.\n\nYou will come away equipped with a powerful new technique for making\nsure your tests are strict and your code is meaningful!\n",
