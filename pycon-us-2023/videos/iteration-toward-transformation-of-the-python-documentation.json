    "description": "With the tremendous growth of the Python ecosystem, attracting an\never-wider audience of users with a variety of backgrounds and\nexperience levels, it is more critical than ever that its documentation\nbetter serve the needs of its diverse array of readers. We formally\nintroduce the Python Docs Community\u2014the self-organized, Python Steering\nCouncil-endorsed collective working toward this goal\u2014and provide a look\nat the major user-facing improvements implemented, underway and coming\nsoon for the core documentation, devguide, PEPs and more.\n\nAlong the way, we'll share the key insights and lessons learned from our\nongoing projects, and how they can help *you* improve the documentation\nof your own projects. And if this sounds like something you might want\nto be a part of, we'll share how you can engage with us and your fellow\ndocumentarians through our community platforms and resources.\n",
