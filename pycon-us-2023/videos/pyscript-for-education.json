    "description": "Python is one of the more accessible programming languages and has been\nadopted by a broad community of users. For educators of all levels,\nPython has become a go-to programming language. However, while there are\nways to distribute creations in Python, they tend to be notoriously\ncomplex, unreliable, or require additional services like web hosting.\nWith the creation of Pyscript, Python projects can be distributed with\nlittle to no web hosting or even internet connectivity. This change can\npotentially bring previously inaccessible topics or tools to a broader\ncommunity while increasing the popularity of Python. This talk will\ndescribe and demonstrate Python and Pyscript's potential opportunities\nin the education space. We will talk about what makes these tools\ndifferent than those previously available and how the future development\nof Pyscript can drive additional education changes in the near future.\n",
