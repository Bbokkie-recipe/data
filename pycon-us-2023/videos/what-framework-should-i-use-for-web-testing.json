    "description": "Web apps these days are bigger than ever! With added complexity comes\nhigher risk for bugs and poor user experience. One of the best ways to\nimprove quality during development is to build feedback loops with\nautomated test suites that run continuously. These days, there are three\nmajor open source test frameworks for automating web UI tests:\n\n-  Selenium, the old-school browser automation tool\n-  Cypress, the darling framework for frontend developers\n-  Playwright, the dark horse rising in popularity\n\nThese three can test any kind of web app, including ones developed in\nPython, but which one is best? In this talk, I\u2019ll give a brief overview\nof each one, including example code for a basic search engine test. We\nwill compare and contrast their features head-to-head so that you can\nmake the right decision for your team.\n",
