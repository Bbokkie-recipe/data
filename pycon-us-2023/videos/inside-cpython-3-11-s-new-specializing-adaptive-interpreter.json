    "description": "Python 3.11 was released on October 24th, bringing with it a new\n`\"specializing, adaptive\ninterpreter\" <https://peps.python.org/pep-0659>`__. As one of the\nengineers who works on this ambitious project, my goal is to introduce\nyou to the fascinating way that your code now *optimizes itself* as it's\nrunning, and to explore the different techniques employed under-the-hood\nto make your programs `25%\nfaster <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#faster-cpython>`__\non average. Along the way, we'll also cover many of the challenges faced\nwhen optimizing dynamic programming languages, some of the\n`tools <https://github.com/brandtbucher/specialist>`__ you can use to\nobserve the new interpreter in action, and what we're already doing to\nfurther improve performance in `Python\n3.12 <https://github.com/faster-cpython/ideas/tree/main/3.12>`__ and\nbeyond.\n",
