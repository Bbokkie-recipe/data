    "description": "Once you're written your amazing new application using Python, the next\nproblem you'll face is how to get that application into the hands of\nusers. If your users are familiar with ``pip`` and and ``venv``, you can\nput ``pip install`` instructions into a README, and leave it at that.\nBut what if your audience aren't Python programmers? What if your app\nneeds to be used by people who don't write Python at all? How do you\ndistribute your code so that others can use it?\n\nIn this talk, you'll learn about **Briefcase**, a tool that can convert\na Python project into platform-native apps on macOS, Windows, Linux -\nand can also target iOS, Android, and the web. You'll learn how to use\nBriefcase to start a new project, or convert an existing project for\ndistribution. You'll learn about the features of Briefcase that can\nsupport you while you develop your application. Finally, you'l learn how\nto generate installers and standalone applications for multiple\nplatforms from a single Python codebase.\n",
