    "description": "`Literate\nprogramming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming>`__ is a\nprogramming paradigm that incorporates explanations in natural language\n(such as Spanish) embedded with the traditional code. Literate\nprogramming allows developers to tell a story with their codes,\nimproving the understanding of the project, focusing on documentation,\nand making it easier to onboard developers. Although being a very\nwell-regarded concept discussed by respected researchers like `Donald\nKnuth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth>`__, literate\nprogramming tools like Jupyter notebooks are considered inefficient for\nserious software development. This perception has limited Jupyter\nnotebooks to simple python scripts and educational materials.\n\nThe `Nbdev <http://nbdev.fast.ai/>`__ library has proven that literate\nprogramming is useful in developing big and serious projects, like\n`FastAi <https://github.com/fastai/fastai>`__. This tutorial will show\nattendees how to get the benefits of literate programming while also\nfollowing software development best practices. We'll get hands-on\nexperience in writing and publishing a Python Package while using\nJupyter Notebooks. In addition to publishing the package, we'll also\nlearn how to deploy the docs, run simple tests and run these tests on\nCI/CD, making sure that our package will only get published if the tests\npass.\n\nEven though this tutorial uses Jupyter Notebooks and Nbdev the student\ndoesn't need previous knowledge of these tools. A simple computer with\nPython and pip installed is all we'll use. Students should have some\nminimal Python knowledge and Git experience (Simple commands like push,\npull, add and commit). A GitHub account will also be necessary.\n",
