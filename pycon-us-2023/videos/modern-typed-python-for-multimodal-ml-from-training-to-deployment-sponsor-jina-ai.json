    "description": "**Typing** is at the center of \u201emodern Python\u201c, and tools (*mypy,\nbeartype*) and libraries (*FastAPI, SQLModel, Pydantic, DocArray*) based\non it are slowly eating the Python world.\n\nThis talks explores the benefits of Python type hints, and shows how\nthey are infiltrating the next big domain: Machine Learning\n\n**Target audience:** Mainly *machine learning practitioners* that care\nabout improving their code quality and making use of the ever evolving\nPython ecosystem. This includes people that focus on *model training* as\nwell as people that focus on *model deployment and serving*. The\nsecondary target audience is anyone that likes to *know more about\nPython type hints* and how they can be helpful in their code base.\n\n**Intended takeaways:** The audience should leave the talk with three\nmain learnings: - Why Python type hints are useful - Why they are\nparticularly useful in the ML domain - How they can leverage libraries\nlike DocArray in practice\n\n**Preliminary outline:** The talk can be seen as two parts:\n\n*Part 1: Typing in Python* - min 0-5: Introduction - min 5-15: Typing\nand type hints in Python: Short history, and why is it useful? - min\n25-25: Tool landscape: Type checkers (mypy, beartype) and other\nlibraries (Pydantic, FastAPI)\n\n*Part 2: Python type hints in ML* - min 25-40: Why is typing useful in\nML? Tensor shapes, multi-modal data, and more - min 40-60: How to get\nthe most out of typing focused tools for ML: jaxtyping and DocArray -\nHow to organize your data using type hints - How to keep track of your\ntensor shapes using type hints - How to bridge the gap between training\nand deployment thanks to typing focused libraries\n",
