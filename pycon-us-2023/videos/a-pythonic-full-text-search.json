    "description": "A **full-text search** on a website is the best way to make its\n**contents** easily accessible to **users** because it returns better\nresults and is in fact used in *online search engines* or *social\nnetworks*.\n\nThe implementation of full-text search can be complex and many adopt the\nstrategy of using **dedicated search engines** in addition to the\n**database**, but in most cases this strategy turns out to be a big\nproblem of **architecture** and **performance**.\n\nIn this talk we'll see a **pythonic** way to implement full-text search\non a website using only Django and PostgreSQL, taking advantage of all\nthe **innovations** introduced in latest years, and we'll analyze the\n**problems** of using additional search engines with examples deriving\nfrom my experience on *djangoproject.com*.\n\nThrough this talk you can learn how to add a full-text search on your\n**website**, if it's based on **Django** and **PostgreSQL**, or you can\nlearn how to update the search function of your website if you use other\nsearch engines.\n",
