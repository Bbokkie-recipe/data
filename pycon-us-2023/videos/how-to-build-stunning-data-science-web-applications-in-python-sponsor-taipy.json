    "description": "This workshop presents **Taipy, a new low-code Python package** that\nallows you to create complete Data Science applications, including\ngraphical visualization and managing algorithms, pipelines, and\nscenarios. It is composed of two main independent components:\n\n-  **Taipy Core**\n\n-  **Taipy GUI**.\n\nIn this workshop, participants will learn how to use:\n\n-  Taipy Core to create **scenarios**, use models, retrieve metrics\n   easily, version control their application configuration,\n\n-  Taipy GUI to create an **interactive and powerful** user interface in\n   a few lines of code.\n\n-  Taipy Studio, a brand-new pipeline graphical editor inside VS Code\n   that facilitates the creation of scenarios and pipelines.\n\nThey will be used to build a complete interactive AI application where\nthe end user can explore data and execute pipelines (make predictions)\nfrom within the application.\n\nWith Taipy, the Python developer can transform simple pilots into\n**production-ready end-user** applications. Taipy GUI goes way beyond\nthe capabilities of the standard graphical stack: Gradio, Streamlit,\nDash, etc. Similarly, Taipy Core is **simpler yet more powerful** than\nthe standard Python back-end stack.\n",
