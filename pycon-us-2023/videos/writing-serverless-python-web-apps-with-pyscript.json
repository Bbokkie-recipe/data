It is now possible to write websites, apps, and\ngames running entirely on the browser.\n\nThis Tutorial is an introduction to PyScript and will walk you through\nlearning about basic concepts, how to set up your project and create\namazing applications. More specifically: - Create your project\nconfiguration - Define a python environment with all the dependencies to\nrun your code - Loading and manipulating with user data - Writing your\npython code - Accessing the DOM and other browser features - Using\nJavascript libraries from your Python application - Optimizing your\napplication - Look at what\u2019s different between \u201cstandard\u201d python vs.\nPython on the browser - Have a lot of fun and hack together on your\nideas!\n",
