    "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have taken the Internet by\nstorm. People are amazed at how these models can generate language with\nthe snapshot of general world knowledge they have accumulated. However,\nin many real-world use cases a snapshot of general world knowledge is\nnot enough. How do you equip them with the relevant tools to solve a\ntask - like SQL, a CRM or web search? Or for a task, how do you control\nwhich tool is used or which knowledge base is referred to? Using LLMs as\nso-called \u201cAgents\u201d allows you to use them as a decision maker in your\napplication that react to all sorts of user requests. Given a user\nrequest, the agents can create an action plan.\n\nIn this talk, we will learn how to build agent-driven applications with\nHaystack. We will show how to build an agent and connect it to other\ntools or knowledge bases. We will illustrate the concept with practical\nuse cases and examples. Each step will be accompanied by code examples.\nBy the end of the talk, you will have seen these concepts applied in\npractice, and you will be able to build an agent-driven application for\nyour own use case.\n",
