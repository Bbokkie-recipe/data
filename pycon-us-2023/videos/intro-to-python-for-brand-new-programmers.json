    "description": "Brand new to programming and want to get some hands-on Python\nexperience? Let's learn some Python together!\n\nDuring this tutorial we will work through a number of programming\nexercises together. We'll be doing a lot of asking questions, taking\nguesses, trying things out, and seeking out help from others.\n\nIn this tutorial we'll cover:\n\n-  Types of things in Python: strings, numbers, lists\n-  Conditionally executing code\n-  Repeating code with loops\n-  Getting user input\n\nThis tutorial is intended to ease you into Python. Each exercise section\nis careful not to assume prior programming knowledge.\n\nI expect you to have experience typing on computers and to have\nrudimentary math skills (just arithmetic). I am not expecting you to\nhave experience with programming. We will define new terms as we use\nthem\n\nYou'll leave this tutorial, having written a couple small programs\nPython yourself. Hopefully you'll also leave with a bit of excitement\nabout what Python can do and curiosity to keep diving deeper.\n",
