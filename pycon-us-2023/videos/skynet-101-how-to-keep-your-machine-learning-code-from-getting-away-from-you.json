    "description": "Machine\u00a0learning can feel pretty mysterious at times, but as python\ndevelopers you have so many of the tools you need to be a part of it!\nWith basic python experience you can use libraries like pandas and tools\nlike Jupyter Notebooks to analyze and manipulate data sets. By apply\nTest-Driven Development practices to you analysis you can feel confident\nabout what your building.\n\nYou can build well developed and well tested cleaning scripts and\nfunctions using pytest and use these functions in your notebooks and\nscripts.\n\nYou can even build simple recommendation engines using libraries such as\nScikit Learn!\u00a0\n\nAs a part of this talk we will walk through the process of data\nanalysis, data cleaning, feature preparation, and building a simple\nmovie recommendation engine.\u00a0 As we move through those steps, my main\nfocus is to teach engineers how they can incorporate Test-Driven\nDevelopment into the data cleaning process and the building of our\nengine.\u00a0 I will also walk through strategies for data analysis and\nexplain at a high level a couple ML concepts that we can use.\n\nAs participants get the chance to see live examples of how to use Test\nDriven Development in data analysis and machine learning they can get a\nhandle on some core concepts and learn how to ensure quality in the code\nthat they produce.\n",
