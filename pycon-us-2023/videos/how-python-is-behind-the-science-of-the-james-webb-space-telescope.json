    "description": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is one of the largest science\nprojects in history. Its aim is to blow the door open on infrared\nastronomy: it has already found the earliest galaxies, will reveal the\nbirth of stars and planets, and look for planets that could harbor life\noutside our solar system. Not to mention it has and will produce a lot\nof spectacular pictures that help us all understand our place in the\ncosmos in a way never before possible. And while there were many varied\nprogramming languages used for development and operation of JWST, the\nlanguage used for most of the science is Python.\n\nIn this talk I will walk through some of the early science of JWST and\nhow it has been made possible by Python and the broad and deep open\nsource Python scientific ecosystem.\n",
