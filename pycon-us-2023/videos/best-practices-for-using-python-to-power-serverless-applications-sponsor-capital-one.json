    "description": "Capital One uses Python to power a large number of serverless\napplications to improve developer experience and increase customer\nvalue. Because Python enables fast development cycles, engineers and\ndata scientists at Capital One have more time to focus on delighting our\ncustomers. Our Python development is also more potent on serverless as\nit eliminates multiple overhead requirements. In this talk, we will\ncover best practices we've learned along the way for using Python to\nbuild serverless solutions to enable a fast, intuitive and iterative\ndeveloper experience for:\n\n-  API calls\n-  Streaming data\n-  Machine learning inference\n\nAttendees will learn the techniques and tools available when using\nPython to build a production-grade serverless system complete with\nobservability and development practices baked in without ever\nprovisioning a server. The presentation will feature a demonstration of\nPython-based AWS Lambda functions-as-a-service.\n",
