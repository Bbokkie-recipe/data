    "description": "Software security is a critical aspect of developing and maintaining\nreliable and safe systems. In the case of large and popular open source\necosystems, such as Python, ensuring security across a wide and diverse\nset of users and use cases can be a daunting task.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the challenges of applying security\nimprovements to a widely used open source ecosystem like Python, and\nexplore strategies for addressing these challenges at scale. We will\ndiscuss the importance of community involvement and collaboration, and\nthe role of automation and tools in facilitating the adoption of\nsecurity best practices.\n\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will have a better understanding of\nthe challenges with and opportunities for improving software security in\nthe Python ecosystem, and will have some practical takeaways for\nadopting and facilitating these changes in their own work.\n",
