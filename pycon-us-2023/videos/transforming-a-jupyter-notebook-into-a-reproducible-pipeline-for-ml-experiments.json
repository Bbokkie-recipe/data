    "description": "Jupyter Notebooks are part of every data scientist's arsenal and for\ngood reason. But while they're great for prototyping in data science\nprojects, they are not ideal for experimenting with different\nconfigurations. I have been guilty of running experiments with changing\nparameters while keeping track on a notepad, and the result has always\nbeen messy.\n\nIn this session, we will explore how we can transform our notebook\nprototype into a reproducible pipeline. We will discuss what goes wrong\nwithout proper experiment tracking, why reproducibility is the key to\nsolving this, and how we can achieve that with Git and DVC.\n\nI will discuss this topic using a text2image project with Stable\nDiffusion. I'll show how to break up a notebook into modules, create a\npipeline from them, run experiments through the pipeline, and compare\ntheir results to find the best possible outcomes.\n\nThe target audience will be data scientists that don't have a strong\nengineering background but would like to move beyond messing about in\nnotebooks. Much like myself a year or two ago.\n",
