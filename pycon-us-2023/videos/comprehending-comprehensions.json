    "description": "Comprehensions are one of the most important \u2014 and misunderstood \u2014 parts\nof Python. In this tutorial, I'll walk you through comprehensions,\nincluding how to write them, and why you would want to do so. By the\ntime you finish this tutorial, you'll fully understand list, set and\ndict comprehensions, as well as nested comprehensions and generator\nexpressions. You'll understand the differences between regular \"for\"\nloops and comprehensions, and where to use them.\n",
