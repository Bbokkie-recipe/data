    "description": "In Machine Learning, features are the inputs for a machine learning\nmodel. Feature Engineering is the process of creating features from raw\ndata and selecting the best features for a model. However, it is not\njust a tool for Data Scientists - Data Analysts and Developers can use\nit too.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will create features that can be used for creating\nData Visualizations, Rules Based Automations, and Machine Learning\nModels. Attendees will learn how to explore, create and select features\nfrom various data types such as \u201cdiscrete/categorical\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d\ndata. Attendees will learn techniques such as One-hot encodings for\ncategories, text vectorization, date manipulation and more.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, attendees will understand how to create\nfeatures for their projects.\n",
