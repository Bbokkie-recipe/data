    "description": "Four years ago, our company embarked on a journey to expose APIs from\nour products. After evaluating two strategies, we chose the open source\nand managed decentralized approach, which has now grown into a\ncompany-scale project.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss our journey of transitioning from a\nmonolithic and centralized development approach to a decentralized\ndevelopment process using common tools, including a common documentation\ntheme, GitHub actions, styling and automation. We will also delve into\nhow we balance developer autonomy with guardrails such as pre-commit,\nauto-code formatting, and flake8.\n\nAt the heart of this journey, we learned that the fundamental problem is\nnever the technology; it's the culture. By embracing open source and\ndecentralization, we were able to unlock new levels of collaboration,\nproductivity, and innovation within our company.\n\nJoin us for a thought-provoking presentation on how you can integrate\nPython and open source into your closed source company and reap the\nbenefits of a more collaborative and productive development process.\n",
