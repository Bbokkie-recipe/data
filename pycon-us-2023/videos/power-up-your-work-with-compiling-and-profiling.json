    "description": "Have you been troubled by Python code that took too long to run? Do you\nwant to know why and how to improve?\n\nIn this workshop, we will introduce Numba - a JIT compiler that is\ndesigned to speed up numerical calculations. Most people found all of it\nis like a mystery - It sounds like magic, but how does it work? Under\nwhat conditions does it work? And because of it, new users found it hard\nto start using it and it requires a steep learning curve to get the hang\nof it. This workshop will provide all the knowledge that you need to\nmake Numba works for you.\n\nThis workshop is for Data scientists or developers who have math-heavy\ncode that would like to speed up with the benefit of Numpy and Numba.\n",
