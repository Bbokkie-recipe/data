    "description": "Do you want to have fun and learn Python? Let's learn how to use\nelectronics and programming to create games using MicroPython and a\nmicro:bit board. In this talk you'll learn how the micro:bit board works\nwith MicroPython and how you can use push buttons, an accelerometer\nsensor and a LED display to create interactive games. The game examples\nwill be Chase the Dot, Genius and Car Crash. For each game we'll see how\nthe game works, the source code and a demonstration.\n",
