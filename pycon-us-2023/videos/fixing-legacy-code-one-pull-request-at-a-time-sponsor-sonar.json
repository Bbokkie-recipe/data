    "description": "Dealing with legacy codebases can be a chore. In this workshop, we talk\nabout modernizing an old Flask application one pull request at a time\nwhile incorporating Python best practices.\n\nWe will talk about how to integrate Code Quality tools in your workflow\nand in your IDE, so that every pull request is checked to good\nstandards.\n\nBy the end of this Workshop, we hope everyone can set up a workflow that\nremoves technical debt over time and makes their codebases sustainable.\n\nThis presentation can be followed interactively. In order to do so, make\nsure that you meet the following prerequisites: - Have an account on\nGitHub and be logged-in - Fork the workshop GitHub repository in your\npersonal account, with all its branches (by default, only the main\nbranch is forked): https://github.com/SonarSource/pycon-sonar-workshop -\nOptionally, have Git and an IDE (PyCharm/VSCode) to clone the\napplication locally\n",
