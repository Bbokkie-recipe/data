    "description": "Command line tools have 2 audiences:\n\n-  humans using it directly\n-  other tools, scripts working together with it\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to build CLI applications for both of\nthese user groups. We'll get to know the Command Line Interface\nGuidelines (https://clig.dev/), an open source, language-agnostic\ncollection of principles and guidelines. We'll build an application\nfollowing those principles in Python, using typer and Rich.\n\nOur short-term goal for this workshop is to build a CLI catalogue of\npast PyCon talks. The long-term goal is to provide tools (incl. code\nsnippets and checklists) that you can use for your own CLI applications.\n",
