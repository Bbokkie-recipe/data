    "description": "For thousands of years, people have created beautiful patterns through\nintricate needlework. Many of these patterns utilize algorithmic\nconcepts like repetition, recursion and variation to build complex\nmotives from simple rules. In this talk, we explore the art of\nembroidery through Python programming and show how you can create your\nown patterns with code.\n\nWe will turn straightforward commands into elaborate and intricate\nartworks with loops, randomness and recursive functions using only the\n`built-in turtle\nlibrary <https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html>`__ in Python.\nThen, we will show how you can turn your art into embroidery patterns\nthat are readable by an embroidery machine using the `TurtleThread\nlibrary <https://turtlethread.com>`__ and how you can use Python to\n`create decorative ornaments for your Christmas\ntree <https://turtlethread.com/main/en/christmas/index.html>`__. This\ntalk is for anyone interested in the intersection between Python\nprogramming, creative coding and arts and crafts!\n",
