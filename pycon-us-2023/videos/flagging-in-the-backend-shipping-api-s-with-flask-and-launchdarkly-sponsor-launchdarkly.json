    "description": "Everyone acts like the party is in the Frontend, but the Backend is what\nkeeps your platforms running. Python has a number of options for\nbuilding backend API's but the most common are Flask and Django. API's\nare the backbone of most applications, and shipping new ones is often\nrisky - but they don't have to be. In this session, Cody will take you\nthrough where he started his coding journey with Python and Flask, go\nhands on with examples of backend API's, and show how you can ship\nfaster and safer using feature flags.\n",
