    "description": "This presentation revisits two core concepts of Object-Oriented\nprogramming: encapsulation and code reuse. Using a series of examples,\nwe'll ask whether these concepts have satisfied their promises, and how\nfunctional approaches can do a better job. We'll also see that objects\nstill have value in making library use easy.\n",
