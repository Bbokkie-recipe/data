    "description": "The talk will explain using an Open Policy Agent (OPA) to ensure that\ngovernance, compliance, and security controls are implemented in the\ndevelopment process. The domain-agnostic nature of Open Policy Agent\nmakes it well-suited for policy management and evaluation for tasks like\nthat. The Implementation example will be developing a solution for\nmanaging SCM (Source Control Management) security at any organization or\nproject's whole CI/CD pipeline. This part of the talk aims to\ndemonstrate how to use Python Open Policy Agent (OPA) Client and build\npolicies to verify the security of SCM (Gitlab or Github)\norganization/repositories/user accounts. The good practices to automate\nthose Policies to Satisfy Common Concerns will be covered in the\npresentation.\n",
