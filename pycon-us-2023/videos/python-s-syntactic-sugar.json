    "description": "Did you know that it only takes 11 pieces of syntax and some special\nfunctions to implement all the rest of the syntax of Python 3.8? It\nturns out you can take something like ``+`` and unravel it into Python\ncode, letting you implement what Python does for a certain piece of\nsyntax all on your own!\n\nThis talk will cover what the minimum bits of Python syntax are needed\nto implement all the other pieces of syntax that Python supports. We\nwill also cover how various pieces of syntax unravel into code to help\nyou have a better understanding of how Python actually works.\n",
