    "description": "As GPUs continue to become faster, PyTorch, one of the most widely used\nframeworks in AI/ML has faced challenges keeping up with performance\ndemands. To mitigate this, parts of PyTorch have been moved into C++.\nThis approach goes against the original intent of PyTorch as a\nPython-based framework and complicates contributions from the community.\nThe PyTorch development team recognized the need to address these\nchallenges while maintaining PyTorch's Python roots and set ambitious\ngoals to improve performance, decrease memory usage, enable\nstate-of-the-art distributed capabilities, and ensure more PyTorch code\nis written in Python. To achieve these goals, they developed a Python\ncompiler. Attendees of this talk will get an inside look at how the\nPyTorch development team approached these challenges and implemented\ntheir innovative solution to achieve a 43% speedup in performance. We\nwill discuss the benefits and challenges of this approach, as well as\nthe techniques and technologies used to build the PyTorch Python\ncompiler. This talk will provide valuable insights into the development\nprocess of and offer attendees a deeper understanding of how PyTorch\ncontinues to evolve and innovate.\n",
