    "description": "Ever wonder how companies like New Relic, Data Dog, and Sentry\ninstrument your code? In this talk we will briefly review how to hook\ninto the Python import system in order to instrument code. We'll present\nsome useful design patterns and tricks of the trade. Then, we'll launch\nstraight into real world examples and challenging instrumentation we've\ndone over the years. Take a deep dive with us into some of the most\npopular Python libraries in use today and learn how they work\nunderneath. We'll talk about proxies, wrapt, async, Python's web server\nspecifications, and more! You will walk away from this talk with an\nunderstanding of how instrumentation works under the hood and how to\nmake your own code instrumentation friendly. You'll also learn about\nvarious design patterns; some that are gotos for instrumentation and\nsome that make instrumentation nightmarishly difficult. We hope you will\njoin us on this instrumentation journey and come away with an\nunderstanding of how it all works to make developer's lives easier.\n",
