    "description": "In the recent years we saw an explosion of usage of Python in the\nbrowser: Pyodide, CPython on WASM, PyScript, etc. All of this is\npossible thanks to the powerful functionalities of the underlying\nplatform, WebAssembly.\n\nIn this talk we will examine what is exactly WebAssembly, what are the\nstrong and weak points, what are the limitations and what the future\nwill bring us. We will also see why and how WebAssembly is useful and\nused outside the browser.\n\nThis talk is targeted to an intermediate/advanced audience: no prior\nknowledge of WebAssembly is required, but it is required to have a basic\nunderstanding of what is a compiler, an interpreter and the concept of\nbytecode.\n\nThe introduction will cover the basics to make sure that the talk is\nunderstandable also by people who are completely new to the WebAssembly\nworld, but after that we will dive into the low-level technical details,\nwith a special focus on those who are relevant to the Python world, such\nWASI vs emscripten, dynamic linking, JIT compilation, interoperability\nwith other languages, etc.\n",
