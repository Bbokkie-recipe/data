    "description": "Nowadays Python is very likely to be the first choice for developing\nmachine learning or data science applications. Reasons for this are\nmanifold, but very likely to be found in the fact that the Python\nlanguage is amazing (\u26a0\ufe0f *opinionated*), and the open source community in\nthe PyData ecosystem is absolutely fantastic (\ud83d\udc99 *that's a fact*\n`1 <https://youtu.be/d9Qm3PPoYNQ?t=800>`__\n`2 <https://pydata.org/diversity-inclusion/>`__\n`3 <https://numfocus.org/>`__). In this context, one of the most\nremarkable features of the Python language is its ability in supporting\nmultiple programming styles (from *imperative* to *OOP* and also\n*functional programming*). Thanks to this versatility, developers have\ntheir freedom to choose whichever programming style they prefer.\n\nFunctional programming is indeed very fascinating, and it is great for\nin-demand tasks such as *data filtering* or *data processing*. Of\ncourse, this doesn't say anything about other paradigms, but sometimes\nthe solution to a data problem could be more `naturally\nexpressed <https://gist.github.com/leriomaggio/aef46a144119544df37649e46b51d64c>`__\nusing a functional approach.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss Python's support to functional\nprogramming, understanding the meaning of *pure functions* (also *why\nmutable function parameters are* **always** *a bad idea*), and Python\nclasses and modules that would help you in this style, namely\n``itertools``, ``functools``, ``map-reduce`` data processing pattern. As\nfor reference data challenges, we will discuss *functional-style*\nsolutions to `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com/>`__ coding\npuzzles, to make it fun, and interactive.\n",
