    "description": "Mathematics is a science and one of the most important discoveries of\nthe human race on earth. Math is everywhere and around us. It is in\nnature, music, sports, economics, engineering, and so on. In our daily\nlife, we use mathematics knowingly and unknowingly. Many of us are\nunaware that forensic experts use mathematics to solve crime mysteries.\nIn this talk, we will explore how Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional\ndetective character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses Mathematics\nand Python programming language to solve crime mysteries. We will solve\nsimple crime puzzles using mathematics and python scripts. Finally, we\nwill solve a few complex hypothetical crime mysteries using advanced\npython concepts. The participants will learn how to use the concepts of\nmathematics such as statistics, probability, trigonometry, and graph\ntheory, and python and its packages such as SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib\nto solve the crime puzzles.\n",
