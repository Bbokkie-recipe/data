    "description": "With the rise of Rust bindings being used in the Python ecosystem, we\nknow that throughput efficiency is one of the top priority items in the\nPython ecosystem.\n\nInspired by the extensibility and ease of use of the Python Web\necosystem and the increase of performance by using Rust as a core, Robyn\nwas created.\n\nRobyn is one of the fastest Python web frameworks in the current Python\nweb ecosystem. With a runtime written in Rust, Robyn achieves\nnear-native rust performance while still having the ease of writing\nPython code.\n\nThis talk will focus on the increased involvement of Rust in the Python\necosystem. It will also demonstrate why Robyn was created, the technical\ndecisions behind Robyn, the increased performance by using the Rust\nruntime, how to use Robyn to develop web apps, and most importantly, how\nthe community is helping Robyn grow!\n\nI will briefly demonstrate my experience and challenges of building a\ncommunity around the project and how it allowed Robyn to ensure a smooth\nsail even in turbulent situations. I shall also share my future plans\nfor Robyn.\n",
