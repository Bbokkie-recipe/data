    "description": "This workshop will teach you how to create a production ready GraphQL\nAPI using Python and Strawberry. We will be using using Django as our\nframework of choice, but most of the concept will be applicable to other\nframeworks too.\n\nWe'll learn how GraphQL works under the hood, and how we can leverage\ntype hints to create end to end type safe GraphQL queries.\n\nWe'll also learn how to authenticate users when using GraphQL and how to\nmake sure our APIs are performant.\n\nIf we have enough time we'll take a look at doing realtime APIs using\nGraphQL subscriptions and how to use GraphQL with frontend frameworks\nsuch as React.\n",
