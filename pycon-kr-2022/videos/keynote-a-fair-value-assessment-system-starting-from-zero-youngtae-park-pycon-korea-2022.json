    "description": "We share our experience in the process of introducing Python and re-creating a quantitative evaluation system at the Financial Asset Evaluation Research Institute. We will briefly introduce what kind of company the asset evaluation company is and what kind of work it does as a discipline called financial engineering. We will also talk about what difficulties there were in the asset evaluation company's evaluation work flow, what concerns they had to resolve the difficulties, and why they chose Python to resolve them. We will also talk about our experience of checking which parts were necessary for the system from the smallest details, what we considered for the staff who were not familiar with Python and system programming, how we set the level of difficulty, how we conducted the training, and what approach we took to introduce it as a living task to the staff. We will also talk about how we structured the system we created and how we realized again that Python is a good tool while creating it.",
