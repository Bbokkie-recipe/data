    "description": "I would like to introduce the method I tried to speed up the sample collection and labeling process, which takes the longest time to create an Object Detection model. When the user uploads several object images, we internally use Python OpenCV to regenerate them into various image types so that they can be used for model training. I will introduce the results I was able to obtain through this and the parts I was concerned about.",
