    "description": "Here are some libraries that you can use when you want to suggest opinions as a reviewer during a Python application code review but lack evidence, when you want to provide evidence for changes as a reviewer, or when you want to automatically handle annoying things that need to be caught during the code review phase. We will learn about dis, a library for analyzing bytecode of Python code, timeit, a library for measuring execution time of Python code snippets, and pre-commit, a git-hook framework that automatically searches for and corrects parts to be caught during code review using git-hook, from the basic usage of pre-commit to how to use it during code review.",
