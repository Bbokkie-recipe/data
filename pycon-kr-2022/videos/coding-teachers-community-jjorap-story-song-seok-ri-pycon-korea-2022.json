    "description": "I would like to introduce the community of public education teachers who code, which started at the end of June, the direction of the community, and the course of the basic Python study that 300 teachers across the country are participating in. Currently, experts in the IT/AI field, such as Upstage CEO Seong-Hoon Kim and Ellis CEO Jae-Won Kim, are participating in the community, and I plan to talk about the value of connecting public education teachers and IT experts who want to contribute to public education.",
