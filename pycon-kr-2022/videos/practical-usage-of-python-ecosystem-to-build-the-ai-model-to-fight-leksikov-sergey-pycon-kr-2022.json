    "description": "We use diverse python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and TensorFlow from data processing to data visualization to fight the Covid-19 disease spread. Besides, by using the Deep Learning python-based framework TensorFlow we have built an Artificial Intelligence system to analyze and predict covid risk infection under various circumstances. Artificial Intelligence is used for generating and interpolating from low-resolution to high-resolution data for various conditions of the experimental setup, particle distribution estimation, and risk infection prediction.",
