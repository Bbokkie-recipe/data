    "description": "Turning your Data/AI algorithms into full web apps in no time with Taipy In the Python open-source eco-system, many packages are available that cater to: - the building of great algorithms - the visualization of data - back-end functions despite this, over 85% of Data Science Pilots remain pilots and do not make it to the production stage. With Taipy, Data Scientists/Python Developers will be able to build great pilots as well as stunning production-ready applications for end-users. Taipy provides two independent modules: Taipy GUI and Taipy Core. In this talk, we will demonstrate how: Taipy GUI goes way beyond the capabilities of the standard graphical stack. Taipy Core is simpler yet more powerful than the standard Python back-end stack.",
