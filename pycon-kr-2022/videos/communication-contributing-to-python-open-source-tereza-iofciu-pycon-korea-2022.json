    "description": "Open Source Software work is not just about being a core contributor or a maintainer, it is also about lots of invisible work in the community. Most of this work requires lots of interactions. If the interactions are about OSS, these would be mostly in English, and although good communication skills are essential, they can also be gatekeeping sometimes. After describing the state of diversity in OSS and in Python I showing some thoughts about how we can build a better communication culture in the Python local and global communities. Why it is important to rethink Code of Conducts, what are the current problems with how people think of Code of Conducts. We can use these as a tool for building more inclusive Python communities. These are reflections stemming from my involvement over the past years in the Python community.",
