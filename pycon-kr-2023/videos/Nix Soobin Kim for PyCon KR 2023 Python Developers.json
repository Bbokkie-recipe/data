    "description": "This session will briefly introduce you to Nix for Python developers.\n\nI will first introduce you to the problems I have experienced in the Python environment, what is Nix, and how to set up a Python development environment using Nix. I would also like to go a little further and introduce you to how to package Python packages and build OCI container images. Finally, I'd like to share some personal experiences and testimonials from years of using Nix.\n\nI hope this helps anyone who is having issues like mine.\n\nKim Soo-bin\nI am Soo-Bin Kim, who is developing the backend and platform from Viva Republica to Python. As we collaborate with Python developers within the team, we're thinking about a more comfortable and consistent development and deployment environment, and we'd like to share that experience with you. There are a lot of shortcomings, but I'll prepare well:)",
