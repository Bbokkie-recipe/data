    "description": ".ipynb files are mainly used when analyzing and researching data using ython. When we share that content publicly, we usually use GitHub. Because GitHub is a developer-friendly code management platform, it's not an efficient platform for non-developing decision makers, stakeholders, and other people to consume content. In this session, we'll look at how to leverage the Jupyter Book to transform your .ipynb file into a publication-level output and share it online for anyone to access.\n\n\nSeongjin Ahn\nI am interested in technologies related to cloud, machine learning, and data science. We're also interested in addressing information gaps caused by linguistic factors. He works at Microsoft as a Technical Trainer and teaches courses to help you understand Data & AI services in Azure.",
