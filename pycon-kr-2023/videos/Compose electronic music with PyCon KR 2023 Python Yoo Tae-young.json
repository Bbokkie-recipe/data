    "description": "While studying midi composition, I thought it would be fun to implement a synthesizer in python, so I planned this session. This session will introduce you to the process of designing sounds and creating music in python.\n\nLearn how computers handle digital audio and how to make music digitally. Try implementing a synthesizer using numpy and pedalboard in python. We will directly implement musical instruments such as piano and drums, and we will play short music made from the musical instruments that we have implemented. No other tools other than python are used in this course.\n\nYoo Tae-young\nHi, I'm Taeyoung Yoo, a back-end engineer at ad-tech company Buzzvil. I develop and operate ad recommendation and allocation services with python and go. I love jazz music and playing the piano.",
