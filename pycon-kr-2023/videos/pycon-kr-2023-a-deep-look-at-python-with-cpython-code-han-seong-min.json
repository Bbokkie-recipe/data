    "description": "When working with Python, we often encounter low-level implementations such as CPU/IO Bound, Selector, Global Interpreter Lock, and AsyncIO. And sometimes, we do not understand the functions of the structure exactly and often develop while memorizing the code pattern. \n\nWhen we have to apply the low-level implementation, we cannot implement it because we have deviated from the memorized pattern, and in this way, we fall into the continuation of abstraction. \n\nIn this presentation session, we have prepared a diagram of the low-level implementations we encounter in Python using CPython code and computer science theories, so that you can take the first step toward understanding the principles that were difficult to understand. \n\nHan Seong-min\nAn engineer who is interested in MLOps and focuses on productization of AI. He is also a member of the GDG community and is trying to create opportunities to foster the developer ecosystem in Korea and exchange information. \n\nHe is currently focusing on configuring the MLOps pipeline for the global market, and he works with engineers from various countries while traveling between offices in Korea and the United States.",
