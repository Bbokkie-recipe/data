    "description": "Arahangul is the most perfect word processor in existence (in my personal opinion). One of the lesser-known great advantages of Arahangul is the existence of script macros that can automate detailed document work. As the Python language gains popularity, work automation is being introduced to the public, but Arahangul automation using Python seems to be less well known. \n\nThis session introduces the world of Arahangul automation by lightly implementing seven examples in Python, from basic text input to somewhat complex report writing logic using Pandas. \n\nShin Myeong-jin \nI work as a Python instructor at an IT academy in Daegu. I share content on creating work automation programs through my YouTube channel/blog Everyday Coding^^",
