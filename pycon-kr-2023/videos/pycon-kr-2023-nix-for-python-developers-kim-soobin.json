    "description": "In this session, I will briefly introduce Nix for Python developers.\n\nI will first introduce the problems I have experienced in the Python environment, then I will introduce what Nix is, and how to set up a Python development environment using Nix. I will also briefly introduce how to package Python packages and build OCI container images. Finally, I will share my personal experiences and reviews from using Nix for several years.\n\nI hope this session will be helpful to those who are experiencing the same problems as I did.\n\nKim Soobin\nI am Kim Soobin, who is developing backend and platforms using Python at Viva Republica. I am working with Python developers on the team and am thinking about a more convenient and consistent development environment and deployment environment, and I would like to share my experiences. There are many shortcomings, but I will prepare well :)",
