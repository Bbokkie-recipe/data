    "description": "The memory size we usually use ranges from 4G to 64G or more. Some companies use larger memory, but most of them are limited to using good equipment due to cost issues. \nIn a limited environment, purchasing expensive equipment can allow for more data and processing, but the reality may not be easy. I would like to use Python to solve various methods that can be used when dealing with large data in a limited environment without spending money. \n\nPark Jo-eun \nI run a YouTube channel called 'Today's Code'. I am also a Microsoft MVP, and I am interested in data and enjoy dealing with data with Python. I have mainly worked as a backend developer at games and advertising companies, and recently I have been giving lectures, creating content, and working on projects at companies, educational institutions, and schools in various domains.",
