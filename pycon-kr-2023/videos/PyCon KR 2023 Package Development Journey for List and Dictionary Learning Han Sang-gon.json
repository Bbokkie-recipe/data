    "description": "In Python 101 class, I created a small Python package to explain lists and dictionaries in a fun way. 101 This is a session where participants will be introduced to the courses and experiences they have found interesting in Python 101 classes using this package, as well as a simple way for anyone to easily create their own small package. If you are interested in Python 101 training, we hope that it will be of some help to you.\n\nHan Sang-gon\nHi, I'm currently a Microsoft MVP. Currently, I am studying programming languages at a university in Busan, and I am studying Python in parallel with classes and Djanog studies. Nice to meet you.",
