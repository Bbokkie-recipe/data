    "description": "\"RustPython is a project to reimplement Python in the Rust programming language.\nAlthough RustPython has always been a novel or interesting project, it was a far cry from Python users.\nThe fifth year of the project RustPython met with Linter Ruff, who is used daily by Python developers around the world. Maybe everyday in the open source world, but RustPython developers aren't expecting this. ”\n\n---\n\nJung Yoon-won\nWe are developing HFT on line. I run an open source project RustPython, cloud input machine, etc. Benefit Python with Rust programming. https://github.com/youknowone",
