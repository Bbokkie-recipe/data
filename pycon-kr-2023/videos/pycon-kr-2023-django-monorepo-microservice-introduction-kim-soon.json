    "description": "In this session, we will share the process of separating Dajngo monorepo microservices using Pantsbuild, an open source Python build tool. While thinking about how to properly separate the management and flexible deployment of services that grow properly on a monolithic server, I became interested in Pantsbuild after watching the Multiple Django Services in a single repo video at DjangoCon Euro 2021. I would like to share my experiences and concerns that I had while setting up a plugin that provides a unified way to manage code, applying mypy type hints, and deploying pex (a Python executable build file) to docker with simple boilerplate code. \n\nKim Soon\nCurrently developing retail-related server applications as a backend engineer at fintech startup Payhere. I like things that are automated and efficient rather than cumbersome. I will not stop challenging myself even if it is slow.",
