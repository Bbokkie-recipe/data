    "description": "Here is an example of Poetry, a Python dependency management tool, being introduced to solve a problem in a deep learning development environment while working as an MLOps engineer in Corca. I will explain the difficulties of testing due to the nature of deep learning, and the dependency problems encountered during the checkpoint packaging process, and tell you how Poetry can benefit you. We hope this session will be helpful to many deep learning developers as well as those who want to be effective in managing dependencies.\n\nJeong Ho-jin\nI'm Hojin Jeong, a researcher and developer, and I'm embarking on a journey to become a person who makes research from theory and real products from research.",
