    "description": "I will share my experience of providing services to multiple regions with a single code base using Django. \nWhen a product or service develops, the code that was provided in one region is expanded to multiple regions. \nIf you were simply thinking about text translation at this time, I think it will be a time to quickly check what additional parts are needed based on your experience. \nThis session is for those who understand the basics of Django. It covers settings and translation, translation of model data, format conversion by region, format conversion of unsupported data, and also introduces the form of the address being provided and the linkage with the front-end application. \n\nSeo Myeong-seok \nI chose Python as a language when I was working in the game industry and thought, “I want to create web/app services too.” I think Python has been a good choice so far because it allows for stable services thanks to its low complexity and rapid development. Recently, I have been interested in flexible service structures, multi-region deployments, GraphQL, serverless deployments, PWAs, etc.",
