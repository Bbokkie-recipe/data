    "description": "Introducing Django's journey to becoming a contributor.\n\nA session to share episodes, experiences, and learnings you've had while contributing to big open source.\n\nWe will talk about the overall process for contributing to open source, including why we started open source, finding bug tickets, understanding the overall flow through debugging, writing bug patches and test code, and reviewing the maintainer.\n\nEspecially if you are interested in open source or have thought about making a contribution.\n\nThank you:)\n\n\nYoon Jun-gi\nHello, I'm Yoon Joon-gi, a third-year back-end engineer. Since I use the Django web framework a lot, I naturally also have an interest in open source activities. Not only do you like to develop code, but you also like to talk and have an interest in many areas related to development, such as good code, culture, communication, and business. I am very excited and excited to present the conference I have dreamed of since starting my career.",
