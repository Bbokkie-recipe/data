    "description": "When I started using Python, one of the things that I had the most trouble with was import. I wanted to learn about import, which was bothering me, and I hope that sharing the process can be of some help to others. \n\nYoon Soo-jin\nI am Yoon Soo-jin, a first-year junior developer who loves Python. I am currently developing using Python and Django at the animation streaming company ‘Raftel’. I started developing relatively late, but I got so absorbed in it that I thought I should bury my bones in this field. There is so much to learn as I develop, so every day is happy. When I open my eyes in the morning, I wonder and look forward to what new things I will learn today. I am from 42Seoul, and I like the saying, ‘If you go alone, you will go fast, but if you go together, you will go long.’ I want to become a developer who goes together and for a long time.",
