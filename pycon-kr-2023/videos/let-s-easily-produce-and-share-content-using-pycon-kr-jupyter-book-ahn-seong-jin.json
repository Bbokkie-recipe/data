    "description": "When conducting data analysis and research using ython, .ipynb files are mainly used. When sharing the content publicly, GitHub is mainly used. Since GitHub is a developer-friendly code management platform, it is not an efficient platform for non-developer decision makers, stakeholders, and others to consume the content. In this session, we will look at how to use Jupyter Book to convert .ipynb files into publication-level results and share them online so that anyone can easily access them. \n\nSungjin Ahn\nI am interested in technologies related to cloud, machine learning, and data science. I am also interested in resolving information gap issues caused by language factors. I am working as a Technical Trainer at Microsoft and am giving lectures to make it easy to understand Data & AI services in Azure.",
