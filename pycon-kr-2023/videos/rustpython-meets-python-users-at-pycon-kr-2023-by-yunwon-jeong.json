    "description": "\"RustPython is a project that reimplements Python in the Rust programming language.\nRustPython has been a new and interesting project for a long time, but it has been a project that has been far from Python users.\nThe 5-year-old project RustPython met Ruff, a linter used by Python developers around the world. It may be considered a daily occurrence in the open source world, but even RustPython developers did not expect this encounter. I will tell you about this story.\"\n\n---\n\nJeong Yun-won\nI am developing HFT at LINE. I operate open source projects RustPython, Cloud Input, etc. I benefit Python through Rust programming. https://github.com/youknowone",
