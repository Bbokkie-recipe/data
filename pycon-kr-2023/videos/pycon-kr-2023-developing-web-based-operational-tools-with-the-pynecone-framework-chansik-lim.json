    "description": "It is not easy to create the necessary operational tools while developing and operating a service. In particular, in a situation where the proportion of backend developers is high, developing web-based tools can be a huge burden. \nHowever, if you use various open sources that help with web development, you can easily start developing the necessary operational tools. In this session, I would like to share my experience developing a web-based operational tool using the Pynecone framework among the various open source projects mentioned above. \n\nLim Chan-sik \nI use Python for various purposes while developing backend systems or operating platforms. Recently, I am developing an on-premise serving platform that can operate high-performance applications based on Kubernetes. I am developing various tools necessary for platform operation in Python, which helps me reduce repetitive tasks and makes operation easier.",
