    "description": "In the PAM authentication process, we will introduce PAM-Python, which can implement the authentication process using Python, and learn how to use it.\n\nYoo Seong-jin\nWhen I started learning Python to use it for work as a system engineer, I didn't know I would become a developer, but I ended up experiencing many projects in various languages, including Go, TypeScript, and JAVA. Now, I am in charge of infrastructure platform development and service backend development at Portray, which researches innovation in the new drug development process using space transcriptomes and artificial intelligence. I am trying to think about what better code and a good development culture are and put them into practice.",
