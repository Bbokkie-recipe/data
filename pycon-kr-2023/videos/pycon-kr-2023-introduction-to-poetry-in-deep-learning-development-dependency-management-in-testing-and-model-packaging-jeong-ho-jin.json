    "description": "I will introduce a case where I introduced Poetry, a Python dependency management tool, to solve problems in a deep learning development environment while working as an MLOps engineer at Corca. I will explain the difficulties of testing due to the nature of deep learning and the dependency problems that occurred during the checkpoint packaging process, and I will tell you what effects you can achieve through Poetry. I hope that this session will be helpful to many deep learning developers as well as developers who want to effectively manage dependencies. \n\nHojin Jeong\nI am Hojin Jeong, a researcher and developer. I am on a journey to become someone who makes research from theory and actual products from research.",
