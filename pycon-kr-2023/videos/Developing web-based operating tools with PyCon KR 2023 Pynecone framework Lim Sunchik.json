    "description": "Creating the operational tools you need while developing and operating your services is not easy. Developing web-based tools is a huge burden, especially with such a high percentage of back-end developers.\nBut with a variety of open sources to help you with web development, it's easy to get started developing the operational tools you need. In this session, we would like to share our experience developing web-based operational tools using the Pynecone framework among the various open source projects mentioned above.\n\nLim Chan-sik\nWe are using Python for various purposes while developing back-end systems or operating the platform. More recently, we are developing an on-premises serving platform to run Kubernetes-based high-performance applications. By developing various tools required to operate the platform in Python, we are getting a lot of help to reduce repetitive tasks and make it easier to operate.",
