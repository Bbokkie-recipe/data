    "description": "I think one of the things that caused me the most headaches when I started writing Python was importing. I wanted to learn about imports that bother me, and I hope that sharing the process will help others a little bit.\n\nSoojin Yoon\nThis is Soojin Yoon, a first-year junior developer who loves Python. Currently, Raftel, an animation streaming company, is developing using Python and Django. I started developing relatively late, but I fell in love with it so much that I thought I should bury my bones in this field. There is so much to learn as we develop, so I am happy every day. When I wake up in the morning, I wonder and look forward to what new things I will learn today. From 42Seoul, I love the saying ‘if you go alone, you go fast, if you go together, you go long’. I want to be a developer together and long-lasting.",
