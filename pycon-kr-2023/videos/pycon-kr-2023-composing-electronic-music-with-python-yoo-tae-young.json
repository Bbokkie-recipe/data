    "description": "While learning MIDI composition, I thought it would be fun to implement a synthesizer in Python, so I planned this session. This session introduces the process of designing sounds and creating music using Python.\n\nWe will learn how computers handle digital audio and how to create music digitally. We will implement a synthesizer using numpy and pedalboard in Python. We will implement instruments such as piano and drums ourselves and play short music created with the instruments we implemented. No other tools other than Python will be used in this process.\n\nYoo Tae-young\nHello, I am Yoo Tae-young, a backend engineer at ad-tech company Buzzville. I develop and operate ad recommendation and allocation services using Python and Go. I like jazz music and playing the piano.",
