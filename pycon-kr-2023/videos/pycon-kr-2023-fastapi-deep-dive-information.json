    "description": "You may have heard of Django and Flask, the two major Python web frameworks.\nSince its release in 2018, there is a new web framework that has been rapidly gaining popularity among developers.\nIt is called FastAPI. It was introduced at PyCon.\nI think many of you have experienced it at least once.\n\nIn this session, we will look at the differences between existing Django, Flask, and FastAPI.\nAnd as the name suggests, we will look at the architecture with a focus on how FastAPI was able to achieve \"Fast.\"\n\nJeong Bo-ram\nCurrently working as a Solution Architect at Microsoft. Before that, I worked on embedded development and financial backend development for about 10 years. I give various lectures in the infrastructure field. I am interested in developing fast, stable, and highly productive code, and I am honored to be given the opportunity to introduce FastAPI.",
