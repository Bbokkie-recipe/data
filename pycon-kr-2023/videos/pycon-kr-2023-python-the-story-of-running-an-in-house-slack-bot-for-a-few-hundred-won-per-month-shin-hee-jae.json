    "description": "I'm sharing a case study of Python Slackbot development that anyone can easily and quickly apply.\n\nBefore my team and I create an internal solution in-house, I'd like to talk about why we chose Slackbot, how we considered the technology stack, and what we can create with Slackbot.\n\nIn addition, I'd like to share the fun of improving the work environment within the team by creating a ChatOps solution based on Slackbot!\n\nShin Hee-jae\nHello, I'm Shin Hee-jae, a backend/DevOps engineer at crypto startup Alokados. I like Python and have enjoyed developing with Python, so I'm very honored to be hosting this PyCon 2023 session. There are many shortcomings, but I'll prepare hard :)",
