    "description": "The amount of memory we normally use can be as small as 4G and as large as 64G or more. Some companies use more memory than they do, but most have limited access to good equipment due to cost concerns.\nBuying expensive equipment in a limited environment can lead to more data and processing, but the reality can be daunting. When we want to deal with big data in a limited, cost-free environment, we want to solve it using Python in a variety of ways that we can access.\n\nJo Eun Park\nI run a YouTube channel called Today's Code. He is also a Microsoft MVP, he has a general interest in data and enjoys working with it in Python. He has worked primarily as a back-end developer for gaming and advertising companies, and has recently lectured or created content and projects for companies, educational institutions, and schools in a variety of domains.",
