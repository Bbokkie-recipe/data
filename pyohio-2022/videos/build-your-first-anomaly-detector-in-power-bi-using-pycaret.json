    "description": "Combining machine learning with business intelligence can have a\nsignificant impact on the insights a business derives from its data.\nPyCaret is a low-code, open-source machine learning library for Python,\nand PyCaret can be integrated within Microsoft Power BI. This empowers\ncitizen data analysts and data scientists to add machine learning to\ntheir dashboards and reports within minutes. In this demonstration, I'll\ngive an overview of PyCaret and outline the different ways it can be\nused to enrich your Power BI reports and dashboards. I'll detail the\nnecessary set-up steps to start using PyCaret\u2019s machine learning\ncapabilities in Power BI. Finally, I'll demonstrate how to train and\nimplement an unsupervised anomaly detector in Power BI using PyCaret.\n",
