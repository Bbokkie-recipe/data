    "description": "This is a call for engagement to help with\n`graphblas-algorithms`_!\nWe'll also have weird math and weird Python syntax,\nso you can also come for the fun of getting your mind blown :)\n\nGraphBLAS is a mathematical abstraction layer designed to express many\ngraph algorithms in the language of linear algebra. It's weird and\nwritten in C.\nIt is also *incredibly* fast and powerful.\nGraph analytics has applications across industries and sciences--more\nthan you might expect--and we want to get the power of GraphBLAS into\nthe hands of Pythonistas and practitioners.\n\nOur package, `python-graphblas`_, allows us to write GraphBLAS in\nthe style of math, not the C API.\nCounterintuitively, by introducing some unconventional notation, we\nwere able to make our library more Pythonic.\nHowever, `python-graphblas`_ is still low-level, and most users\nprobably won't use it directly.\nInstead, most people will probably want to use\n`graphblas-algorithms`_,\na library that looks like `NetworkX`_, the most popular graph library\nin Python.\n\n`graphblas-algorithms`_ is young.\nIt is growing and has great potential, but it could use more help.\nWho can help? Anybody who is interested! We have a well-defined\ntarget--the `NetworkX`_ API and its tests--so\nit's very easy to find things to do.\nWe actually find it fun like solving puzzles, and there is still a lot\nof low-lying fruit.\nIf you don't know much about graphs or how to contribute to\nopen-source, this could be a great way to learn!\n\n.. _`graphblas-algorithms`: https://github.com/python-graphblas/graphblas-algorithms\n.. _`python-graphblas`: https://github.com/python-graphblas/python-graphblas\n.. _NetworkX: https://networkx.org/\n",
