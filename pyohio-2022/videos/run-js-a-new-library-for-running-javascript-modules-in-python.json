    "description": "`run-js`_ is a new Python package that enables users to easily run\nJavaScript modules in Python without breaking from the familiar Pythonic\nsyntax. With inspiration from `sh`_, it wraps the module instance\nintercepting requests. This talk will go over cool examples on how to\nuse run-js and also dive into its internals, explain sys.modules, dunder\nmethods, and how to pipe data between JS and Python processes.\n\n.. _run-js: https://github.com/danieljdufour/run-js\n.. _sh: https://github.com/amoffat/sh\n",
