    "description": "Velocity is an important metric to a lot of software teams, but in my\nexperience, it\u2019s often been the most important metric to management \u2014\noften at the expense of missing out on the rest of the story. In this\ntalk, we'll explore Earned Business Value, Lead Time, and Cumulative\nFlow to examine how these metrics might deliver additional insight into\nteams' development lifecycles.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about software metrics, I recommend these\ntwo books:\n\n-  `Software Development Metrics`_ by David Nicolette\n-  `Agile Metrics in Action`_ by Christopher Davis\n\n.. _Software Development Metrics: https://www.manning.com/books/software-development-metrics\n.. _Agile Metrics in Action: https://www.manning.com/books/agile-metrics-in-action\n",
