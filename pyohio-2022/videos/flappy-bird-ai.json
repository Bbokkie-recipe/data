    "description": "Flappy Bird is one of the most popular mobile games in the world. The\ngame consists of a bird that can flap up and down as it navigates\nthrough the gaps in many pipes to receive a higher score.Through my\nadventures with python and AI, I have been learning about genetic\nalgorithms and how they work. I used the flappy bird to expand my\nknowledge of theory and applications of genetic algorithms, neural\nnetworks, and much more.
