    "description": "`CircuitPython`_ is an open source version of Python, designed to run on\ntiny computers called microcontrollers. It has, from the start, focused\non being beginner friendly and lowering the barrier to entry for new\nfolks into programming and electronics. This focus has led to creating a\nlanguage that is considered, by educators, to be an excellent option for\nteaching in various environments, including university and high school\nclasses, code camps, and more. CircuitPython has accomplished this in\nmultiple ways, including: easy access to `thorough documentation`_,\nbuilding a welcoming and supportive `community`_, extensive `hardware\nsupport`_, making it simple to `get started`_, and, most importantly,\nmaking learning fun! Discover how and why CircuitPython is a great\nchoice for education.\n\nSlides and talk resources can be found `here`_.\n\n.. _CircuitPython: https://circuitpython.org\n.. _thorough documentation: https://learn.adafruit.com/category/circuitpython\n.. _community: https://adafru.it/discord\n.. _hardware support: https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/bundle/en/latest/drivers.html\n.. _get started: https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython\n.. _here: https://github.com/kattni/PyOhio2022\n",
