    "description": "Cloud-native application security involves balancing contradictory\nrequirements: the benefits of cloud services in accelerating\ndevelopment, while at the same time handling security in an adverse\nenvironment where there are more attack surfaces and opportunities for\ndata breaches. Unfortunately, many security tools do not address the\nvulnerabilities of APIs that run in those containers. Cloud-native\napplications expose many internal API services and developers are\nincreasingly using external API services for their applications. Both\ninternal and external API use expose the workload to new\nvulnerabilities; more strongly, workload security and API security are\nreally two sides to the same coin.\n\nThis talk specifically focuses on the security problems and\nvulnerabilities exposed through APIs, and introduces Cisco\u2019s Panoptica,\na tool for discovering, managing, and repairing these vulnerabilities,\nand APIClarity, Panoptica\u2019s open source core.\n",
