    "description": "From Data Science and Machine Learning to Software Engineering and\ntesting, access to accurate data is one of the biggest bottlenecks\nhindering development. Developers need accurate, relevant data to safely\nexperiment when building applications, machine learning models, testing,\netc. However, developers often run into issues gathering data, from a\nlack of data to the inability to access the data due to privacy\npolicies. But what if you could have instant access to an unlimited\nsupply of high-fidelity data that\u2019s statistically accurate,\nprivacy-protected, and safe to share? This is where Synthetic Data comes\nin. In this talk, you'll learn about Synthetic Data, the problems it\nsolves, and how to get started generating as much relevant data as you\nwant.\n\nIn this talk, we'll discuss what Synthetic Data is, the benefits of\nusing Synthetic Data, and the efficacy of it. You'll see real-world\nsituations where Synthetic Data removes bias, augments data sets, and\nmakes once private data easily shareable while still protecting the\nprivacy of the initial data set.\n",
