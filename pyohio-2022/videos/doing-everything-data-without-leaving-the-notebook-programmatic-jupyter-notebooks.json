    "description": "Jupyter notebooks is one of the most powerful tools for any data\nscientist. It makes doing tasks like data wrangling, modeling,\nvisualizing really quick and easy for even people with not a lot of\nexperience in software engineering.\n\nBut, a problem arises that to actually put that code into production\ninvolves a lot of copying, pasting, and refactoring into order to be\nused in a full fledged system. But what if we didn't have to leave the\nnotebook? What if the notebook could be the production ready code?\n\nThis talk will giving an introduction to using the papermill library,\nhow it works, why it's powerful, and an actual use case of how I use\npapermill in a pipeline that transforms raw data into clean tidy data,\nand then runs multiple many notebooks to generate various visualizations\nand statistics to be later used in a study.\n",
