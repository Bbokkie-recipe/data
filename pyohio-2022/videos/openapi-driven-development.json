    "description": "As a service owner, one needs to provide strong guarantees for the\nbehavior of their APIs. To avoid eroding developer trust in your\nservice, we show how we guarantee strong contracts using `OpenAPI`_\nwhile avoiding extraneous overhead for service owners. This talk shows\nhow to autogenerate OpenAPI schemas, prevent breaking changes\nautomatically with your CI/CD, and how we improved the delivery cycle\ntime for our teams.\n\nAt `Zapier`_, we connect over 5,000 of your favorite online apps\ntogether. We've learned how to produce high-quality APIs with over 10\nyears of experience integrating with APIs. We're applying these best\npractices as we break out our services from our Django monolith.\n\n.. _OpenAPI: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0\n.. _Zapier: https://zapier.com\n",
