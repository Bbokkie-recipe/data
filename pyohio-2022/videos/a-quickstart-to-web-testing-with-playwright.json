    "description": "Playwright is a fantastic new open source web testing framework from\nMicrosoft. With Playwright, you can automate tests for web apps and REST\nAPIs that run on multiple browsers without flaky failures. It's a nice,\nmodern alternative to Selenium WebDriver, and you can use Playwright in\nplain-old Python!\n\nIn this concise 10-minute quickstart, we'll learn how to configure a\nPython project with Playwright and ``pytest``, automate a basic web\ntest, and run it against different browsers. You'll be able to add more\ntests to our starter project on your own after the talk!\n\nExample code with full instructions can be found here: https://github.com/AutomationPanda/playwright-python-tutorial\n",
