  "description": "Write Any Python Program in One Line and Only Using Lambdas! - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nAny program can be written in just one statement and only using lambda.\n\nSounds weird? The first claim will bring us into what functional programming is (+ map, functools...); the second one will dig into \u03bb calculus.\n\nBut why? You will learn the power of \u03bb and how to be concise: a better pythonist!\nThis talk will cover:\n\n- Recursion!\nRecursion enables to write simple and concise python code. We will bring many examples of recursion, how to make it fast with memoizing and what tail call optimization is.\n\n- Mutable vs Immutable objects!\nSince FP uses a completely immutable approach, this might be the right time to learn about tuples, frozendicts, and all immutable data structures.\n\n- Higher order functions!\nYou can pass functions as arguments and return them in functions. There are many functions in python that use this feature: sort, min, max, map, filter etc.\n\n- Functools!\nFunctools is the standard python library containing many useful functional tools. The library functions will be all explained properly, such as partial and reduce, often used in FP. \n\n- Lambda calculus!\n\u03bb calculus is the first functional language! In fact, a \u03bb calculus interpreter could be written using exclusively the lambda statement (no loops, numbers, standard functions, libraries, anything).\n\n\nSpeaker: Niccol\u00f2 \u00abVeggero\u00bb Venerandi",
