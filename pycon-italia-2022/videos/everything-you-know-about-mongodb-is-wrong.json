  "description": "Everything You Know About MongoDB is Wrong - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nMongoDB is webscale, right? It's a JSON database, it's eventually consistent. Oh, and it's insecure.\n\nLet me clear up some things: MongoDB is an ACID-compliant database with transactions, schemas & relationships. It includes a powerful aggregation query language. MongoDB doesn't store JSON, and nowadays it comes with pretty good security defaults (we think).\n\nI'll cover all of this and more, so you know what you need to, if you're considering MongoDB for your next (or current) project.\n\nSpeaker: Mark Smith",
