We will automate dotfile configuration, facilitate Python interpreter and virtual environment management, and supercharge our terminals with powerful command-line tools.\nWe spend hours each day in a terminal console, so let\u2019s make the most of that time by enhancing our command-line productivity. Together we will automate dotfile configuration, facilitate Python interpreter and virtual environment management, and supercharge our terminals with powerful command-line tools.\n\nManaging our shell configuration, commonly referred to collectively as \u201cdotfiles\u201d, can be an onerous task. Thankfully there are tools like Ansible and Chezmoi that we will use to more effectively automate dotfile management in versioned repositories, which we can then easily deploy to both personal workstations and remote servers.\n\nGiven the pitfalls inherent in distro-packaged Python interpreters [1], building and managing our own Python interpreters efficiently has never been more important. Thankfully, we will use tools like ASDF to make this incredibly easy, as well as examine its similar benefits for Node.js/NPM and *hundreds* of other languages and tools, all via extensible plugins. For Fish shell users, we will see how VirtualFish makes it easy to create, upgrade, and activate virtual environments in ways that have never been available before.\n\nFinally, we will explore how powerful command-line tools like Zoxide, Bat, RipGrep-All + fzf, and others can be used to dramatically increase our terminal console productivity.\n\nAttendees of this talk will take home the following knowledge and skills:\n\n* how to automate dotfile configuration management and deployment\n* how to build and manage multiple Python interpreter versions\n* how to more efficiently manage Python virtual environments\n* how to use powerful command-line tools to increase terminal console productivity\n\n[1]: \n\n\nSpeaker: Justin Mayer",
