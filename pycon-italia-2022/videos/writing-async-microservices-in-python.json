  "description": "Writing async microservices in Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWriting an async microservice is a good way to improve the concurrency of your platform and decouple the different components of a web platform, Python provides excellent tools to write them and we're going to introduce some of them for you to immediately start creating your own.\nWhile not exactly new, async programming has arrived quite recently in the Python core. This enabled to create a wide ecosystem of async-first or async-enabled libraries and frameworks that makes async programming more available to the everyday developer.\nWriting an async microservice is a good way to get your hands dirty with async programming: we are going to see how to build it using FastAPI and its ecosystem to show tecniques and pitfalls.\n\nSlides: \n\n\nSpeaker: Iacopo Spalletti",
