  "description": "Python's Life of the Brain - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nIn this talk, you will learn how to analyse the data coming from the human brain, how to visualise and process individual neurons, how to design customised cognitive experiments and finally how to create your own brain from scratch in jupyter notebook!\nThere is no need to praise Python for its ubiquitousness in various areas of industry or science. We all know about Python applications to engineering, web development, data analysis, or machine learning. But an emerging number of packages appear that allow scientists and brain research enthusiasts to analyse the data coming from the brain, visualise and process individual neurons from various brain areas, design customised cognitive experiments and finally simulate the whole brain in silico! In this talk, you\u2019ll learn how to do that, without leaving your jupyter notebook.\n\n\nSpeaker: Dominik Krzeminski",
