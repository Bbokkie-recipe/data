  "description": "Four years of Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nInspired by my post Four Years of Python  where I talk through some valuable lessons for intermediate/beginner programmers to have in mind when scaling up their career in Python development. I mention topics such as testing, keeping things simple, and educating yourself.\nThe other day I realized: I've been programming in Python for about 4 years now. I do get paid to write code, but for some reason still don't consider myself a pro. I did learn some valuable lessons however. For those who just got started with Python, you'll hopefully take something out of these lessons. For the experienced, see this as a celebration of our beloved language. \n\nSome of the topics I'll cover are:\n- Reading is better then googling\n- Keep things stupid simple\n- First make it work, then make it pretty \n- Test early \n- Learn continuously \n\nI'll share some learnings, principles, and resources that I've learned through the years.\n\n\nSlides: \n\n\nSpeaker: Duarte Carmo",
