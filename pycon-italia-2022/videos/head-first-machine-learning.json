  "description": "Head First Machine Learning - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nEvery wanted to learn Machine Learning, or at least understand the basics, but you don\u2019t know where to start? Math scares you? Bad experiences with it during Calculus 1 or at the High School? No worries! In just 1hr, I\u2019m gonna turn audience into ML rockstars!\nMachine Learning is nowadays expanding. As more data becomes available (and power calculation), so are algorithms that can solve new challenges. But how does Machine Learning exactly work? And why mathematics shouldn\u2019t be a stop? In this speech, I would like to give a brief introduction on the Machine Learning field and explain its concepts in the most easiest and \u201cHead First\u201d way. Digging in mathematical concepts will be, of course, necessary, but no prior depth knowledge of math will be required, as I will try to keep things as simple as possible.\n\n\nSpeaker: Gianmarco Forcella",
