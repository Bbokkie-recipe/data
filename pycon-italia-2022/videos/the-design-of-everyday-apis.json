  "description": "The Design of Everyday APIs - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWhat makes a good API for a library? Or more importantly, what makes it bad? This talk will discuss the principles of what goes into user-centered design, and how best to apply those principles when writing a Python library for fellow developers.\nWhat makes a good API for a library? Or more importantly, what makes it bad? \n\nImplementing an API is an art. It's the connection between the user and the library itself. How can we optimize that connection to make the experience more pleasing? What makes a user reach for one library over another? What goes into an ergonomic API?\n\nThis talk will first discuss what makes an API good: documentation, simplicity, consistency, completeness, and flexibility. We will apply those elements by looking at developing and iterating on our own library.\n\n\nSpeaker: Lynn Root",
