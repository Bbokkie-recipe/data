Do you think it is important?\nImagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. \nThis talk will tell you a secret trick about documentation.\nDo you document your code? Do you think it is important?\n\nImagine that you need to get back to your code in 6 month after you wrote it, there is always a big possibility that you will have to spend some time to find out how this code works. Or if someone else wrote some code, which is already in production and your task is to fix a bug in it and there is no documentation and no one actually knows what this code does.\n\nThere are more benefits of implementing continuous documentation for the code:\n\n- easy to onboard new team members,\n- easy to share knowledge,\n- if this code is open source - easy to start contributing,\n- easy to see purpose and motivation of each piece of code,\n- easy to keep versioning for each new release of the code.\n\nIt this talk I will show the difference between documentation types and will show a demo in the end of the talk.\n\n\nSpeaker: Anastasiia Tymoshchuk",
