With this talk, you will be surprised how simple, yet powerful, Pattern Matching really is. \n\nThis talk and you, it is a match! \ud83d\udd25\nPython 3.10 is out there now. This was a two-digit minor version change since the last release, and with this release new ways of thinking about programming were brought to the Python language - Pattern Matching. \n\nWe will understand what was there before Python Pattern Matching and how to use Pattern Matching in different scenarios. We will pattern match from simple data types to more complex ones, such as dictionaries and objects. We will also understand how to use guards, and how can build composable patterns.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you will be surprised how simple, yet powerful, Pattern Matching really is. This talk and you, it is a match!\n\n\nSpeaker: Laysa Uchoa",
