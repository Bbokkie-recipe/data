  "description": "/metrics, a must have - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nWith modern applications being distributed, only testing is enough to ensure your apps are healthy? \nThe web is wild and users are unpredictable. Having a good strategy of observability in place is essential.\nIn this talk, I'll demo how to setup extensible metrics in your app using open-source tools\nWith the advent of microservices and all that jazz, the complexity of monitoring applications increased quite a lot.\nHow many instances of my app do I have running?\nAre they all healthy?\nHow is it performing under heavy load?\nQuestions like that can not be answered by guesses only, but you need data to be more assertive. \n\nIn this talk, we will create a sample web application and instrument it using Prometheus (and potentially other tools such as Grafana, Jaeger, Alert Manager, etc) and see in practice how we can monitor web applications in real-time.\n\n\nSpeaker: Luiz Marques",
