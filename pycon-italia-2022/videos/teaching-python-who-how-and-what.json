  "description": "Teaching Python: who, how and what - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nPeople consider Python the easiest languange to learn, and they are right, likely. Many students in (non-scientific) Universities think that learning Python is a nightmare, expecially if is mandatory.  \nSo, do we have the right strategies to bring our language to all? (I do not, but I am learning)\nAfter a few years of courses I realized I (we?) need a strategy to teach Python properly.  While it is really exiting to teach PhD students how to make use of a script language in their own projects, it is really hard to show its beauty and opportunities  to second year students when they hardly have the concept of a folder, a variable, and if they have them, they are usually quite confused.\nI would like to share my (little) experience, the good and the bad, so to make a few suggestions for a general and shared approach to teaching: should we introduce levels (A, B, C?), what are the best books to use, how to make exams?\n\n\nSpeaker: GIANFRANCO DURIN",
