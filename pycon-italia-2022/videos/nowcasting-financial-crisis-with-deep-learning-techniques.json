  "description": "Nowcasting financial crisis with deep learning techniques - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nIn this tutorial, I'll show how train machine learning models to predict a financial crisis event in the next 20 days.\nSpecifically, we'll speak about:\n- preparation of the dataset\n- selection of variables with RandonForest  and Boruta\n- training and the predictions\n- measure of our performances\nThis tutorial shows how apply Regression Models and Deep Learning Models to \nnowcasting stock markets crisis events.\nSpecifically, we'll how the transmission mechanisms across stock markets can \nbe used to train machine learning models to predict crisis events. The tutorial'll show \nthe entire pipeline: from the preparation of the dataset,\nhow balance observations and how measure our performances.
