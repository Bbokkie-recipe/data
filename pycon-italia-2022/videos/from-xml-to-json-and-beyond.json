  "description": "From XML to JSON and beyond - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nI want to share my experience on converting XML data to JSON, talking about the existing conventions, some that expect a loss of information and others that are lossless, with a focus on conversion methods defined by XPath 3.1.\nJSON has been often described as an XML alternative or even a replacement. This can be true in several applications, but many often XML persists due to its more richer characteristics and pretty different architectural scopes. So crucial is the build of conversion tools and mapping conventions, to let the data communication effective between the different formats. Despite many defined conventions also XPath 3.1 put a step in this direction. So don't trash old XML data, but use them for what is better suited and convert them to send chunks of JSON data to other systems or to submit to other applications.\n\n\nSpeaker: Davide Brunato",
