Has it always been like this?\n\nWe'll investigate the way humans perceive plans and unexpected events. We'll find out that we have biases in the way we make plans and predictions. Problems are not limited to the planning phase though. When the first issues occur during the project, we tend to take decisions like increasing the team or taking shortcut that might not have the desired outcome.\n\n\nSpeaker: Marco Santoni",
