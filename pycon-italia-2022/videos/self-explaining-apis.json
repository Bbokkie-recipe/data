  "description": "Self-explaining APIs - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nTo mash up various APIs you need data to have a well defined meaning: imagine meshing up healthcare APIs using different units for human temperature, or financial APIs using different currencies.\n\nThis talk describes strategies and python tools to overcome these problems in large API ecosystems.\nThis talk will present strategies and python tools to create semantically interoperable REST APIs.\nAfter the problem statement, various solutions will be presented, including:\n- contract-first api development with OpenAPI 3, ontologies, controlled vocabularies;\n- the rdflib and pyld python libraries;\n- the use of centralized catalogs.\n\n[Very draft slides here](\n\n\nSpeaker: Roberto Polli",
