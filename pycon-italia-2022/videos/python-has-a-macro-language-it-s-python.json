  "description": "Python has a macro language: it's Python - PyCon Italia 2022\n\nA small but growing number of Python projects, including `attrs`, `cattrs` and `incant`, use Python to generate Python.\n\nWe will example concrete cases of code generation in these libraries and go over the 'how' and the 'why'.\nMacros in mainstream languages are generally a tool for metaprogramming, probably the most famous examples being preprocessor directives in C and C++, and Rust macros.\n\nPython has rich metaprogramming capabilities baked in through the compile and eval built-in functions, although a little care needs to be taken for the generated code to be debuggable and properly shown in track staces.\n\nWe will examine one concrete example of metaprogramming in each of the attrs, cattrs and incant libraries.\n\n\nSpeaker: Tin Tvrtkovic",
