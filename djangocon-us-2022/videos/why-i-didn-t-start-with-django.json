    "description": "When I started learning Python, it was exciting&mdash;uncharted territory ahead. With powerful tools at my fingertips and plenty of ideas, they needed to find a place to land. A web framework, perhaps?\n\nI bombarded my search engine with variations of \"which Python framework should I use.\" This led me to several \"batteries included\" vs \"microframework\" comparisons, with varying degrees of usefulness.\n\nThis talk will highlight some reasons I ultimately decided to build my blog, [Python By Night](https://www.pythonbynight.com), on the backbone of FastAPI, and where I am today on my Python journey.",
