    "description": "The amazing layers of technology that are required to deliver online experiences can be\nstaggering and feel miraculous. It is easy to become overwhelmed, feeling we should\nunderstand all of these layers, and end up wallowing in impostor syndrome. This talk\nwill take an opportunity to poke fun at some of the more absurd moments in my own life,\nand celebrate the miracle that **anything** we do actually works at all!\n\nWe work in ecosystems that are often anarchies. What can our communities learn from\nsome of the most successful anarchies in human history, addiction recovery programs?\nThere may be more parallels than you think!\n\nJoin Tim on a journey where we pan the camera around to the third-person perspective,\nand laugh at ourselves a bit. It'll be therapeutic: laughter is the best cure for\nimpostor syndrome!",
