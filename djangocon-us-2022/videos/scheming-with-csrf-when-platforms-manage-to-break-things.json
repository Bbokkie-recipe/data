    "description": "When Django 4.0 was released, a small change to the `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` was in the change notes: the scheme must now be provided.\n\nThis change would cause any deployment on Cloud Run to fail. But not App Engine. \ud83e\udd14\n\nFollow along as we dive into the complexities that Django saves you from, what managed services handle for you (that you have no control over), and what happens when these things don't work as expected. We'll dive into PEP-3333, CGI specifications, WSGI implementations, and what happens when the standards don't actually tell you what to do.\n\nAttendees will come away with an understanding of how important it is to set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to prevent all this in the first place.\n\nA note on Audience Level: This talk is written to be accessible to beginners, while tackling advanced topics. This speaker is happy to help any attendee lost with the content after the talk in the conference hallway \u2728",
