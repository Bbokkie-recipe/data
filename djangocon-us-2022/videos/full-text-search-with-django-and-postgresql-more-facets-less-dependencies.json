    "description": "We\u2019ll describe some issues we faced with some bulkier and less supported search options. Django\u2019s core functionality has come a long way since 1.10 and all the tools you need are there without having to bring in more dependencies. We\u2019ll discuss the history and evolution of django-haystack and backends including Elasticsearch.  We\u2019ll explore adding facets, queryset annotations, and FTS techniques to whittle down the data into more efficient chunks of Data in a Django application. We\u2019ll use a simple project to demonstrate how to extend django-filter to do what we needed and how we separated and rebuilt indexes. Hopefully, after our talk, more developers will be better equipped to use the built in tools already available.",
