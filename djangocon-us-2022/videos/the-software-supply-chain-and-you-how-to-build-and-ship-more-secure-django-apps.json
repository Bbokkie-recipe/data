    "description": "This talk will provide a high-level overview of the developer-first open source project, Sigstore, within the Django context. We\u2019ll go through each component of Sigstore, including how to sign a software artifact with Cosign, how Fulcio issues certificates, and finally how developers and end users alike can verify claims made on the Rekor public ledger. We\u2019ll discuss how PyPI is leveraging Sigstore to help with verifying and trusting dependencies we all rely on. Finally, we\u2019ll go through a demonstration of creating, publishing, and signing a containerized Django app.\n\nThe audience will walk away with an understanding of how they can navigate software security more effectively and be better citizens of open source through implementing recommended security practices.",
