    "description": "Python has grown to be the largest programming language in the world; that\u2019s one big pool. But like all things tech there are too many things that keep folx out of the water, and lots of ways we can get them diving into the deep end.\n\nThis talk shares the perspectives of two developers who benefitted from a community that was welcoming, supportive, and awesome. They\u2019ll share the advice they did and DIDN'T receive; stories from along the way; and how those of us already floating can make room for all the new people wanting to join in on the fun. Grab your floaties, kids\u2014let\u2019s jump in.",
