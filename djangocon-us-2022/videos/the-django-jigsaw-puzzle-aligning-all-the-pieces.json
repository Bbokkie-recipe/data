    "description": "Learning Django often feels like trying to solve an immense jigsaw puzzle with the pieces all turned upside down. It's hard to align all the pieces when you don't know how they should fit together.\n\nThis talk is based on over a decade of using and teaching Django professionally. I will cover all the major puzzle pieces of Django: how they work independently and together. I don\u2019t expect anyone to have mastery over all these pieces--I certainly don\u2019t--but knowing the overall picture of Django and what the pieces are will provide a roadmap for learning and improving your Django abilities no matter your current level.",
