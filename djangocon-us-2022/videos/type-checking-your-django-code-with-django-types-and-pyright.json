    "description": "Among the topics we'll cover are:\n\n- A brief history of Django type stubs\n- Which type stubs, and which type checker: `django-stubs` or `django-types`, `mypy` or `pyright`?\n- Starting a project with type hints, or adding type hints to an existing project\n- Where to focus: adding type hints to Django models and views\n- Workarounds for when the type stubs aren't quite right\n- Configuring `pyright` for type checking: running `pyright` on the host, in a container, on a CI server\n- `pyright` and LSP clients: turning your text editor (Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, VS Code, etc) into a full-fledged Python/Django IDE\n- Type hints for documentation, code navigation, and refactoring\n\nThere will be live coding in the presentation. All code is open-sourced on GitHub, and links will be provided.",
