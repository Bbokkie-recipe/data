    "description": "Objectives\n\nAudience members will learn why ranges are more useful than distinct start and end values, will become familiar with range-based terminology, will have the opportunity to see a number of approaches to using and querying with ranges, and will have resources for further reading and learning. These resources will include a link to a GitHub repository containing the examples from the talk, additional examples, and a cheatsheet for working with ranges.\n\nOutline\n\nThe naive approach to ranges (2 min)\n\n- Using separate start and stop model fields\n- Querying with start and stop values\n- Quickly gets complicated\n\nRange visualization for concrete understanding (3 min)\n\n- Terminology\n- Inclusive vs Exclusive\n- Overlap\n- Contains\n- Contained By\n- Comparisons (fully_lt, fully_gt, etc)\n\n[diagram](https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/19424336-bc96-4a42-a5cb-a8ff04928caf/image.png)\n\nA before-and-after look at the models (5 min)\n\nThe example project is a Swimming Pool Resource Scheduler that makes heavy use of ranges (probably more than would be used in most projects) in order to demonstrate various approaches. The model layout can be visualized in the following diagrams:\n\n![database schema simple](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacklinke/home-on-the-range-with-django/master/presentation/img/erd_light.png)\n\n![database schema detailed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacklinke/home-on-the-range-with-django/master/presentation/img/erd.png)\n\nWe will look at the models before and after using range fields.\n\nThe initial (stripped down) models.py file using distinct fields for lower and upper values is:\n\n.. code::\n\n    class Pool(models.Model):\n        \"\"\"An instance of a Pool.

If two reservations have the same lower, also sort by upper. (This is the default behavior in django)\n- Get reservations with an overdue start (the reservation time started, but the party has not yet checked in)\n- Get reservations with an overdue end (the reservation time ended, but the party has not checked out)\n- Given a datetime (and other filtering criteria), get the count of reservations at that moment\n- For a particular Lane (or set of Lanes), get the aggregate count/sum of reservations during each hour of a daterange\n- Sum of all swimmers at a given moment\n- Sum of all swimmers at each time period change\n- For a particular Lane or entire Pool, get the time and value of all changes in number of swimmers\n- Given a start time stop time and a Lane, return a queryset of the swimmers at each 15 minute increment.\n- Calculated overall usage (number of swimmers * time interval = swimmer hours) within a time range\n- Total usage by day/week/month by Pool/Lane\n- Usage by range:  Given a list of ranges, calculate the usage during each range\n- Prevent overlapping reservation_period for the same resource (here, it's Rooms), where the reservation has not already been cancelled\n- Add validation to model field for minimum and maximum datetimes\n- Aggregate the minimum Lower and maximum Upper reservations dates for all reservations in a queryset\n- Similarly, annotate the minimum Lower and maximum Lower reservations dates for all reservations in a queryset\n- Assuming each reservation is associated with a Resource, annotate Resources with the most recently ending reservation (similar for most recent starting or longest-ago starting/ending reservation)\n- Multiple ways of saving a model instance with DateTimeRangeField\n\n*Note: Those examples above which we are unable to cover during the talk can be viewed in the example project GitHub repo which will be provided for the talk*\n\nResources (5 min)\n\n- [psycopg2.extras](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extras.html)\n- [This talk & Example Project](https://github.com/jacklinke/home-on-the-range-with-django)\n- [django-range-merge](https://github.com/jacklinke/django-range-merge/) - use `range_merge` aggregate with Django\n- [django-generate-series](https://github.com/jacklinke/django-generate-series) - create sequences with Django's ORM\n",
