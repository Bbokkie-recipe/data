    "description": "We\u2019ll start out simple by speeding up search results for big models so you can traverse through 40 million row tables in seconds. We\u2019ll continue on and gain a deeper understanding of the `clean`, `save_model` and the `__init__` functions as these functions are where a lot of customization happens in the Admin. I\u2019ll show you how to use multiple databases within one Admin website and even customize the basic Admin templates so you can have documentation right there on the CRUD pages.\n\nBy the end of the talk, you\u2019ll have a new mindset and a toolkit for how to customize the Django Admin to your unique needs.\n\nIf you attend this talk, you\u2019ll walk away with the following:\n - An understanding of how key functions work behind the scenes\n - The ability to go a step beyond the basic out-of-the-box setup and functionality\n - Confidence that you can implement custom features for your team\n - A sense of excitement about the Django Admin!\n - A new mindset for how to customize the Django Admin to your needs",
