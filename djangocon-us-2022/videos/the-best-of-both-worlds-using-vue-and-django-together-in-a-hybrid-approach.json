    "description": "In this talk, we\u2019ll discuss our rationale for choosing this approach over other approaches like XHTML, etc. We\u2019ll then dive into some code and show what exactly we mean by a Hybrid of Vue and Django. Then we\u2019ll discuss some of the lessons we learned and what we might do differently next time.\n\nWe hope that those that attend this talk would walk away feeling inspired to try things that leverage the strengths of your team and the best features of the technologies in your toolbox.",
