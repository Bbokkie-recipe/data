    "description": "ETL systems have become commonplace in our world, from tiny personal web scrapers to complex distributed data pipelines. With Django offering a fully async API, new possibilities have opened to simplify the many different microservices into a single Python application that hosts the scrapers, query systems, and administrative interface all in one box. With this comes simplified code and deployment, and many other benefits.\n\nThis talk will cover a case study in building this kind of all-in-one ETL system, the components used, and how they all fit together. This includes both API and web scrapers, GraphQL for querying and streaming, and a Discord interface for notifications and control.",
