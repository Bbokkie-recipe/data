    "description": "Django is a versatile web framework that can be used for building a wide range of applications, from blogs to e-commerce platforms. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for web-based data visualization, which requires integrating data visualization libraries with web frameworks like Django. This talk will demonstrate how to use D3.js and Bokeh, two popular data visualization libraries, with Django to create dynamic and interactive visualizations.\n\nWe will start by discussing the basics of Django and data visualization with D3.js and Bokeh. We will then dive into the specifics of integrating these libraries with Django. You will learn how to leverage Django's powerful database and ORM to feed data to your visualizations, and how to customize your visualizations with CSS and JavaScript.\n\nWe will also cover some advanced topics, such as real-time data streaming with Django Channels and integrating machine learning models with your visualizations. By the end of this talk, you will have a solid understanding of how to integrate D3.js and Bokeh with Django for your data science projects. You will leave with the skills needed to create stunning and interactive visualizations that can be embedded in your Django web applications.",
