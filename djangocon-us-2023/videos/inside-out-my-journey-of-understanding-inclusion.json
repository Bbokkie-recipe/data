    "description": "In this talk I'll share my personal journey of understanding diversity and inclusion.\nBeing part of a minority group, I have encountered numerous challenges, I've learned\na lot, and made my fair share of mistakes along the way.\n\nThis presentation is an opportunity to reflect on my experiences, sharing the lessons\nlearned and real-life stories that have shaped my view on the matter. Get ready for a\ncaptivating array of anecdotes!\n\nI'll openly discuss the challenges I've faced and the insights I've gained,\nhighlighting both successes and shortcomings, always offering a perspective rather than\ndefinitive solutions or comprehensive analysis. I'll cover topics such as tone connotations,\ninclusive[n|l]ess of different languages, the importance of company policies, quirks\nderived from cultural and social norms, and more. In the final segment of this talk, I\nwill discuss my recent experience within the Django project and community as a whole.\n\nThis talk is not intended to provide a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather to inspire\nthought, reflection, and positive change. I hope to encourage open dialogue among\nattendees, as we explore strategies for creating a more inclusive, diverse and\nequitable environment.",
