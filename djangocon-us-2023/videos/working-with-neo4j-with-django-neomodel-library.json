    "description": "My talk aims to provide a comprehensive overview of graph databases, going through the basics and fundamentals concepts.\n\nGraph databases are used for real-time transaction applications, Metadata and Advanced Analytics, Internal Business Process, and much more! There are plenty of use cases for graph databases such as recommendation systems, customer engagement, knowledge graph for AI, and so on.\n\nThe best part is that you can visualize the data you store as nodes, and the queries you make as well, so it is easier to identify patterns and relationships within the data. This can help gain deeper insights into the data and make more informed decisions based on your findings.\n\nAlso, the attendees will see how it can work with Django, using neomodel as an interface to communicate with Neo4j.\n\nLast but not least, we will dive into some of the graph algorithms, to take advantage of this kind of database and explore possibilities.\n\nThis is an entry-level talk for people interested in databases. Basic database knowledge is recommended.\n\nWe\u2019ll cover:\nWhat is a graph database with Neo4j\nPossible use cases\nDifferences between queries with Sql and Cypher language\nHow to transform a relational database into a non-relational database\nA use case with Formula 1, using Django neomodel library, showing the graph data model, the graph that built and some interesting queries",
