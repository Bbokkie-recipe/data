  "description": "This talk is for those who want to pierce the veil of abstraction and learn how their Python code is actually executed on a computer. First we will start with a guided overview of the Python Run Time envioronment in the CPython interpreter. Next will be an overview of the builtin inspect package and how it allows for direct access to the python runtime in your own Python code. After which I will show how you leverage this knowledge in PDB.",
