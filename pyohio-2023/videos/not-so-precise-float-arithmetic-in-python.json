    "description": "Just like in other programming languages, floating number arithmetics is\nnot very precise in Python. What makes floats so special and weird that\na simple arithmetic operation might not yield the expected result? Why\nis it so? For instance, what happens when you run the following line on\nthe Python terminal: 0.1+0.1+0.1==0.3? What will be the output? True or\nFalse?\n\nThis small talk will focus on the underlying behavior of floating\narithmetics precision and then discuss a few potential solutions to the\nproblem in Python.\n",
