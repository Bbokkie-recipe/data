    "description": "Code is organic: it grows and rots with neglect. So does the associated\n\u201cmeta-code\u201d - like docs, tests, configurations, and requirements. This\nis fertile soil for Zombies, a horde of which can seriously disrupt the\nsoftware development process.\n\nIn this talk, we'll explore how automated testing strategies can be used\nto identify and minimize drift in meta-code. Techniques of yore - such\nas Behaviour-Driven Development and Living Documentation - are\nresuscitated before your eyes using the arcane magic of Large Language\nModels (LLMs). Limitations / good targets for application are discussed\nin the context of the author's experience.\n\nAnd if you act now, we'll throw in two other hyphenated proper nouns\n(Provider-Driven Contracts and Example-Based Requirements) for free!\n",
