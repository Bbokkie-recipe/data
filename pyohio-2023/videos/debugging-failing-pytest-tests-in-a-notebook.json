    "description": "This talk describes how to use the ``pytest-ndb`` package for debugging\nfailed pytest tests using a notebook.\n\nIn our opinion, developers should often prefer to debug failing tests\nusing a debugger such as pdb. However for certain applications, such as\nthose that occur in data science with large complex data sets or long\nrunning models, this is can be quite difficult. Debugging a failing test\ncan mean having to analyze data, for which there is little support in a\ndebugger and where notebooks truly shine.\n\nTraditionally to debug in a notebook, all of the code from the test,\nincluding fixtures and parametrizations, must be copied. For simple\ntests this might not be an issue, but for a complex test it can be quite\ntime consuming. Instead, you can use ``pytest-ndb``!\n",
