    "description": "I will be discussing the use of digital signal processing techniques\nusing various Python libraries, such as numpy and scipy, as alternatives\nto classic signal engineering approaches in MATLAB. An introductory\nwalk-through example will be given, as well commentary on how to\npipeline processed signal into machine learning libraries such as\nscikit-learn and tensorflow2.\n",
