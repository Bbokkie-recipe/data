    "description": "PEP 593 introduced the ``Annotated`` Type in Python 3.9, allowing typing\nmetadata. In 2023, usage of the type by popular libraries has\nsignificantly increased. For example, ``FastAPI`` and ``Pydantic`` have\nfully adopted the ``Annotated`` type and recommend it as the preferred\nsyntax for their functionality. In this talk, we will explore usage of\nthis type in open source projects and take a look at how it might be\nused in your code.\n",
