    "description": "Writing cloud native Python is one of the easiest ways to build an\napplication for AWS. However, when it comes to running unit tests on\nyour code, how do you ensure that your API calls to other AWS services\ndon't actually change things? Thats where The Stubber comes in! A\nlesser-known part of AWS's python SDK Boto3, The Stubber is a way to\nmock your API calls and return exactly what AWS promises that you will\nget when you invoke their APIs without actually invoking them. This talk\nwill cover why its important to unit test your Python AWS Lambdas, how\nto use the Stubber, and a demo running unit tests with the Stubber.\n",
