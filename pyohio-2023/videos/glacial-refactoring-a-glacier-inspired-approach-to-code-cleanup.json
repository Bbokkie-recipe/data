    "description": "Explore a glacier-inspired approach to understanding and refactoring\n(seemingly) complicated code. Learn how the glacial retreat can help you\nunderstand code and codescapes. This intentionally slow-moving method\nallows the safe reworking of scary-looking code through a practical\nincremental approach. Transform code mountains, cliffs, lakes, and\ncaverns into flattened out easy to explore codebase.\n",
