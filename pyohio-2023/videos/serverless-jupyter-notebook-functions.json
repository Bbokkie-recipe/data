    "description": "Jupyter notebooks are awesome! They are a great tool for both Python\nbeginners and experienced professionals alike. A problem arises when we\nhave to \"productionize\" our Jupyter notebook code into a web service.\nWhat if we didn't have to rewrite our code to do this? That's where\nJupyrest comes in! Jupyrest is a library I created to solve this exact\nproblem for my team at Microsoft. In this talk I'll show you how you can\nturn your Jupyter notebooks into a web service without any modifications\nto it. Jupyrest is being used at Microsoft to power hundreds of\nmicroservices.\n",
