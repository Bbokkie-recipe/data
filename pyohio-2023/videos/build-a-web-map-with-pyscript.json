    "description": "PyScript allows you to run Python code in a browser, like JavaScript\ndoes. It also lets you import geospatial mapping libraries like Folium\nand GeoPandas, all without actually installing anything! In this talk,\nwe'll discuss the benefits and ease of using PyScript for this task,\nthen we'll go through a basic geospatial analysis and display the\nresults in a web map. In the end we'll have an app that can be easily\nshared, containing Python code that anyone can view and run.\n",
