    "description": "The swag bags for PyCon 2019 included an Adafruit Circuit Playground\nExpress, a lovely little circuit board with many inputs and outputs,\nand\u2014crucially for us\u2014the ability to run Python. With the power of Python\nand a few other bits of software, it\u2019s possible to turn one into your\npersonal \u201cOn Air\u201d light. This talk will walk the viewer through the\nsteps required to accomplish this, and reference related resources for\nthe sake of inspiration. There will be pretty lights.\n",
