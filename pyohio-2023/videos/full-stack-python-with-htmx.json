    "description": "These days, JavaScript dominates the front-end web ecosystem because it\nis the primary language for the browser. That means you need to use\nJavaScript for dynamic web page interactions, even if your backend is\nwritten in a different language like Python. However, that's no longer\nthe case! Thanks to `HTMX <https://htmx.org/>`__, we can develop dynamic\ninteractions directly in hypertext rather than in explicit JS code. In\nthis lightning talk, I'll show you how to create a `full-stack Python\napp <https://github.com/AutomationPanda/bulldoggy-reminders-app>`__ with\nFastAPI, HTMX, and a few other Python tools. You will learn how to build\nmodern web apps entirely in Python \u2013 as well as how HTMX democratizes\nfront-end web development!\n",
