    "description": "I developed my first CGI script in 1998. Since that day I have seen a lot of hypes coming and going.\n\nThe talk will consist of three parts:\n\n* My humorous odyssey of trying to find a great frontend framework\n* Retrospective: What do I want from the frontend?\n* I finally found: HTMX: HTML Fragments over the wire\n* How to use HTMX with Django\n\nBesides simplicity, good Web Vitals performance (SEO) is a benefit of this method.\n\nThe talk will express my personal opinion, feelings and fun. It won't dive into technical details.",
