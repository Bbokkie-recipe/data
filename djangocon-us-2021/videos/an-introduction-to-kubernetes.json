    "description": "Every other job opening for an IT position mentions Kubernetes. But unless you\u2019ve worked with Kubernetes or seen it in action, you probably only have a vague idea of what it is, what it does and can do, or how to use it. And that\u2019s understandable. It\u2019s this big, abstract, software, that is supposed to \u201csolve all the problems\u201d. In this talk I\u2019ll go through some of the concepts Kubernetes has. We\u2019ll approach these by deploying a Django application, with the intent, that next time somebody asks you, \u201cDo you know Kubernetes?\u201d, you can confidently answer \u201cYes!\u201d.",
