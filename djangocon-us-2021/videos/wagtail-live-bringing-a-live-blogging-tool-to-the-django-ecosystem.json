    "description": "People want their news as fast as possible. Increasingly, large news organisations are using 'live blogging' techniques to bring breaking stories to the public as they happen - this could be goals in a soccer match, or the unfolding events of an election night.\n\nAs a student on the Google Summer of Code programme, I'm bringing a tool like this into the Django ecosystem. I've been working on Wagtail Live, a project to help reporters submit text, images and videos from lightweight tools like Slack, Telegram and WhatsApp, directly into a CMS that updates the content for its audience in real time.\n\nIn this talk, I'll show you how to use Wagtail Live to build a live blog in your own app.\n\n- First, we will give a better overview of what a live blog is.\n- We will then explain how Wagtail Live makes live blogging happen.\n- Last, we will go through the steps of building a live blog with Wagtail Live and Slack from A to Z.",
