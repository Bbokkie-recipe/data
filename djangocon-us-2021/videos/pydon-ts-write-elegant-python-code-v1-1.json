    "description": "In this talk I show what idiomatic Python code looks like and illustrate how the subjective notion of \"beautiful\", or \"elegant\" code, can make your code objectively better, regardless of your Python skill level.\n\nWe do that by visiting several vanilla Python features that people sometimes forget to learn, as they rush to ``import`` ing all the shiny modules and frameworks they really want to use.\n\nIn order to achieve this, we go through the learning journey of a hypothetical Pythonista, taking a function written by them and refactoring it incrementally through the use of Pythonic idioms and patterns.\n\nThe whole talk will build around a weekly series of articles I have been publishing, where I explore all the vanilla Python features that make Python one of the most interesting programming languages to learn.",
